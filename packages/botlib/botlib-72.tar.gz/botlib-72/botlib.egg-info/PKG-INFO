        BOTLIB is a library you can use to program bots. no copyright. no LICENSE.
        
        
        I N S T A L L
        
        
        download the tarball from pypi, https://pypi.org/project/botlib/#files
        
        
        you can also download with pip3 and install globally.
        
        ::
        
         > sudo pip3 install botlib --upgrade
        
        if you want to develop on the library clone the source at bitbucket.org:
        
        ::
        
         > git clone https://bitbucket.org/botd/botlib
         > cd botlib
         > sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        if you want to have BOTLIB started at boot, run:
        
        ::
        
         > sudo bin/install
        
        this will install an botd service in /etc/systemd/system
        
        
        U S A G E
        
        
        ::
        
         > bot -m bot.rss localhost \#dunkbots botje
         > bot -y
         > botd 
         > botcmd <cmd>
         > botctl <cmd>
        
        logfiles can be found in ~/.bot/logs.
        
        
        C O N F I G U R A T I O N
        
        
        use botcmd to edit localy and botctl to edit on the system installed botd service:
        
        ::
        
         > botcmd cfg krn modules bot.rss,bot.udp
         > botcmd cfg irc server localhost
         > botcmd cfg irc channel #dunkbots
         > botcmd cfg irc nick botje
         > botcmd meet ~bart@127.0.0.1
         > botcmd rss rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
        use the -w option if you want to use a different work directory then ~/.bot.
        
        
        R S S
        
        
        start the rss module by adding rss to the modules option at start:
        
        ::
        
         > bot -m bot.rss 
        
        add an url:
        
        ::
        
         > botcmd rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
         ok 1
        
         run the rss command to see what urls are registered:
        
         > botcmd rss
         0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
         the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:
        
         > botcmd fetch
         fetched 0
        
        
        U D P
        
        
        using udp to relay text into a channel, start the bot with -m bot.udp and use
        the botudp program to send text via the bot to the channel on the irc server:
        
        ::
        
         > tail -f ~/.bot/logs/botd.log | botudp 
        
        
        M O D U L E S
        
        
        BOTLIB contains the following modules:
        
        ::
        
            bot.dft		- default
            bot.flt		- fleet
            bot.irc		- irc bot
            bot.krn		- core handler
            bot.rss		- rss to channel
            bot.shw		- show runtime
            bot.udp		- udp to channel
            bot.usr		- users
        
        BOTLIB uses the LIBOBJ library which gets included in the tarball.
        
        ::
        
            lo.clk		- clock
            lo.csl		- console 
            lo.hdl		- handler
            lo.shl		- shell
            lo.thr		- threads
            lo.tms		- times
            lo.typ		- types
        
        
        C O D I N G
        
        
        if you want to add your own modules to the bot, you can put you .py files in a "mods" directory and use the -m option to point to that directory.
        
        basic code is a function that gets an event as a argument:
        
        ::
        
         def command(event):
             << your code here >>
        
        to give feedback to the user use the event.reply(txt) method:
        
        ::
        
         def command(event):
             event.reply("yooo %s" % event.origin)
        
        
        have fun coding ;]
