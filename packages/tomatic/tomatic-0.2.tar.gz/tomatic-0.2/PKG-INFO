Description: Tomatic
        =======
        
        **Tomatic** is a library that helps add automatic setup capabilities on **Python** programs and avoids that configuration files became bloated with unnecessary lines of code. It has originally designed to be used in `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ projects working directly in `settings.py` but can be used with any other Python program.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        Requires at least **Python 3.5** due the use of type hints (`PEP484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_).
        
        Installing
        ----------
        Use `pip` to install **Tomatic**, running:
        
        `pip install tomatic`
        
        Or you can clone or download this repository for manual install.
