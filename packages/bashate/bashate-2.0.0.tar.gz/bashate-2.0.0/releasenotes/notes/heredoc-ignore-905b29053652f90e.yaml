fixes:

  - Ignore contents of ``heredoc`` values.  ``heredocs`` usually
    contain content in a foreign syntax so ``bashate`` will no longer
    consider them.

  - Continuation lines are now parsed into an array, rather than a
    single logical-line.  This fixes continuation lines being
    incorrectly reported as too long.

  - |
    Indentation now allows emacs-formatted idents, where continuation
    lines for long commands align to the first argument above (rather
    than a strict modulo of 4).  e.g.

    ::

       longcommand arg1 arg2 arg3 \
                   arg4 arg5

    will no longer trigger a bad indent warning.

  - Use ``bash -n`` to detect unclosed heredocs, rather than construct
    our own parsing.

  - Correctly check for newlines at the end of all files; even if you
    only specify one file to check.
