class GraphConfig(BaseConfig):
    """A Graph is a directed acyclic graph of layers.

    It is the topological form for creating a computational graph.
    The graph contains a list of layers/tensor operations, i.e.

    ```yaml
    - layer_name:
        arg1: value
        arg2: value
    - layer_name:
        arg1: value
        arg2: value
    ```

    The graph must define its inputs, i.e. `input_layers`,
    usually the names of the tensors that these graph is expecting from a preprocessing step.

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: ['input1', 'input2']
      layers:
        - layer_name:
        ...
    ```

    A graph can also specify the outputs, i.e. `output_layers`,
    when not specified, the `output_layers` will contain by default the last layer.
    when specified, if the `output_layers` do not contain the last layer it will be added.

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: ['image']
      layers:
        - Dense:
          units: 2
        - Dense:
          units: 2
          name: last_layer
    ```

    This is equivalent to

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: [image]
      layers:
        - Dense:
          units: 2
        - Dense:
          units: 2
          name: last_layer
      output_layers: [last_layer]
    ```

    Defining multiple outputs could be achieved in different ways,
    either by listing all `output_layers` or by using the `is_output: True` on the specific layer.

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: [image]
      layers:
        - Dense:
          units: 2
          is_output: true
        - Dense:
          units: 2
          name: last_layer
      output_layers: [last_layer]
    ```

    Means that, both `last_layer` and `dense_1` are in the list of the `output_layers`.

    This is the same as

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: [image]
      layers:
        - Dense:
          units: 2
        - Dense:
          units: 2
          name: last_layer
      output_layers: [dense_1, last_layer]
    ```

    A graph can optionally have a name

    ```yaml
    graph:
      name: cool_graph
      input_layers: [image]
      layers:
        - ...
    ```

    Args:
        name: the name of the graph
        input_layers: `str` or `list` of `str`, the input layers for the graph.
        output_layers: `str` or `list` of `str`, the output layers for the graph.
        layers: `list`, list of layers.

    Polyaxonfile usage:

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: image
      layers:
        - Dense:
            units: 128
        - Dense:
            units: 256
            name: dense_out
    ```

    or

    ```yaml
    graph:
      input_layers: image
      layers:
        - Dense:
            units: 128
        - Dense:
            units: 256
            name: dense_out
      output_layers: dense_out
    ```
