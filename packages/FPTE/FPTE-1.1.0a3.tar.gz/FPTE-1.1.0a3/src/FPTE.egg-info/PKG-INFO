        **Elastic Stifness Coefficients from Stress-Strain Relations:**
        
        
        According to Hooke's law, the second-rank stress and strain tensors for a slightly deformed crystal are related by
        
        $$ $$
        
        where the fourth rank tensors c<sub>ijkl</sub> and s<sub>ijkl</sub> are called the elastic stiffness coefficients and elastic compliance constants respectively. Here we deal with elastic stiffness coefficients c<sub>ijkl</sub>, which govern the proper stress-strain relations at nite strain. In general, we can write
        
        $$ $$
        
        
        where X and x are the coordinates before and after the deformation. There are 81 independent stiffness coefficients in general; however, this number is reduced to 21 by the requirement of the complete Voigt symmetry. In Voigt notation (c<sub>ij</sub>), the elastic constants form a symmetric 6x6 matrix
         
        $$ $$ 
        
        In single suffix notation (running from 1 to 6), we can also use the matrix representations for stress and strain
        
        $$ $$ 
        <br>
         and 
        
         $$ $$
        
         where the stress components are  &sigma;<sub>1</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>xx</sub> ;  &sigma;<sub>2</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>yy</sub> ;  &sigma;<sub>3</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>zz</sub> ;  &sigma;<sub>4</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>yz</sub> ;  &sigma;<sub>5</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>zx</sub> ;  &sigma;<sub>6</sub> =  &sigma;<sub>xy</sub> , and the strain components are &epsilon;<sub>1</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>xx</sub> ; &epsilon;<sub>2</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>yy</sub> ; &epsilon;<sub>3</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>zz</sub> ; &epsilon;<sub>4</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>yz</sub> ; &epsilon;<sub>5</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>zx</sub> ; &epsilon;<sub>6</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>xy</sub> . When a crystal lattice is deformed with strain (&epsilon;), new lattice vectors a are related to old vectors **a**<sub>0</sub> by **a** = (I + &epsilon;) **a**<sub>0</sub> , where I is identity matrix. The stress-strain relations are then simply given by
        
         $$ $$ 
        
         The presence of the symmetry in the crystal reduces further the number of independent c<sub>ij</sub> . A cubic crystal having highest symmetry is characterized by the lowest number (only three) of independent elastic constants, c<sub>11</sub>, c<sub>12</sub> and c<sub>44</sub>, which in matrix notation is
        
        $$ $$
