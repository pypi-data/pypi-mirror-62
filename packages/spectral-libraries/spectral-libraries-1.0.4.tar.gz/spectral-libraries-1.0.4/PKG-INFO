Description: About The Spectral Library Tool
        ===============================
        
        The Spectral Library Tool software package is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package that provides a suite of
        processing tools for multi- and hyperspectral spectral libraries.
        
        The software is based on VIPER Tools: code written for ENVI/IDL and released in 2007.
        Several updates have been released since and now it has been ported to PyQGIS in the period 2017 - 2020.
        The original VIPER Tools is now split over two python/QGIS tools: Spectral Library Tools and MESMA.
        
        **Spectral Library Tool** provides the following:
         - Creating spectral libraries interactively (selecting spectra from an image or using regions of interest) and managing
           the metadata (developed by HU Berlin)
         - Optimizing spectral libraries with Iterative Endmember Selection, Ear-Masa-Cob or CRES
         - Website: https://spectral-libraries.readthedocs.io
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/spectral-libraries
        
        **MESMA** provides the following:
         - Running SMA and MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...)
         - Post-processing of the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, ...)
         - Website: https://mesma.readthedocs.io
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma
        
        The software has now been developed in the open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.

        What is new in the MESMA tool 1.0?
        ==================================
        
        Differences between Viper Tools 2.0 and the MESMA tool 1.0:
         - The migration to PyQGIS is not just a translation from IDL to Python, but also a serious re-write of the code and a
           revision of the GUI to match the look and feel of other QGIS tools.
         - The output of the MESMA tools has been optimized, breaking backwards compatibility with the IDL tools.
         - A tool for visualisation of the MESMA results has been introduced. A first draft of this tool had been proposed for
           Viper 2.0, however this was not yet user-friendly and therefore later removed again. The visualisation tool included
           in this version is a revision of the former tool, with a focus on user friendliness and GIS.
         - The post-processing tool for integration with DEM has been removed.
         - Extra post-processing tool: Soft to Hard Classification (transforms the fractions image into a classification image)
