<hr>

NOTE: This package is having an identity crisis and might soon be deprecated. We need to decide why this package exists 
while ```functools.partial``` does a similar job.  

<hr>

note that this package is **still in development**  
version 1.0 will be the first major release  
until then, consider this code heavily volatile

yet, install simply by calling ```pip install refunction```
