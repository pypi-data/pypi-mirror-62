# Overall driver for sourdough scripts

# `sourdough foo bar` will look for sourdough-foo-bar.

  Process the command line arguments and run the appropriate sourdough subcommand.

  do `sourdough aws foo bar` and the executable sourdough-aws-foo exists, we'll call
  it with the argument bar.

  We deliberately don't do anything with the arguments other than hand
  them off to the sourdough subcommand. Subcommands are responsible for their
  own argument parsing.
