Sourdough
=========

|License| |CircleCI| |Code Climate| |Issue Count| |GitHub stars| |GitHub
last commit (branch)|

Sourdough is a tool to install ``chef-client`` during instance boot, or
to run ``chef-client`` after boot.

Sourdough reads the **Environment** and **Runlist** EC2 / VMware tags
and runs ``chef-client`` with those settings so you can update an
instance’s Chef settings just by tweaking its tags. This also lets you
see what runlist and environment an instance has using just the
AWS/VMware webui, so no more having to correlate Chef information for
your instances in two places.

Testing
=======

Pre-requisites
--------------

You must have ``docker`` and ``docker-compose`` installed on your
machine to run the test suite.

How to run the tests
--------------------

``make test`` will build a container, then run the tests inside the
container with ``docker-compose``.

**WARNING** only run the tests inside a disposable container - they
*will* **destroy** the chef installation on your machine.

FAQs
====

How are node names generated?
-----------------------------

EC2
~~~

If we’re in EC2, we look for a Node tag/knob. If a Node tag or knob
exists, our node name will be **AWS_REGION-NODE_TAG_KNOB-INSTANCE_ID**

If the node tag and knob don’t exist, we look for a Hostname tag or knob
and set the node name to **AWS_REGION-HOSTNAME_TAGKNOB**.

If the Hostname tag or knob are both missing we fail back to reading the
output of ``hostname`` which is better than nothing.

Outside EC2
~~~~~~~~~~~

If we aren’t in EC2, we look for a ``/etc/knobs/Hostname`` file and use
the contents of that - if there’s no knob file we use the output of
``hostname`` so we have at least something sane-ish.

How is the runlist determined?
------------------------------

EC2 / VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we attempt to read the instance’s **Runlist** tag and set the
runlist to that. If we can’t reach AWS/vSphere to read a tag, we search
for ``/etc/knobs/Runlist`` and use the contents of that. If we still
haven’t found a **Runlist** setting we look for a **default_runlist**
entry in ``/etc/sourdough/sourdough.toml``. Once we determine a Runlist,
we write it to ``/etc/knobs/Runlist`` to use as a fallback on future
runs.

What Chef environment does Sourdough use
----------------------------------------

Similarly to how it determines the Runlist, ``sourdough`` looks for an
**Environment** tag for the instance, and if that is missing, looks for
``/etc/knobs/Environment``, and finally falls back to looking for a
**default_environment** entry in ``/etc/sourdough/sourdough.toml``

How do I have sourdough pass environment variables to chef-client?
------------------------------------------------------------------

``sourdough`` will look for
``/etc/sourdough/environment-variables.json``, and if present and *valid
JSON*, will pass the variables inside to ``chef-client`` when it runs
it.

VMware Vcenter configuration
----------------------------

``sourdough`` will look for ``/etc/sourdough/vmware.toml``, and if
present and *valid toml*, it will search for the UUID of the VM in the
vSphere host(s) listed there. Check the ``example_vmware.toml`` file for
configuration details.
