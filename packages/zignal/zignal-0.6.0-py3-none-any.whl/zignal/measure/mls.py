    implements the "tricky" bits when it comes to MLS sequences. An efficient
    generator is needed since MLS is based on shift registers where we are
    dealing with bits.

    It should not be needed to create an instance of this class directly. Use
    the derived child class instead. When debugging or trying to understand
    the inner workings of MLS then this class can be instantiated with a low
    value for N. For example, N=3 will yield an MLS sequence of length 7. This
    is short enough for a pen and paper exercise when trying to apply circular
    cross correlation.

    The basis of MLS theory is not depending on a sample rate. This is because
    we are dealing with sequences of ones and zeros. This can be translated to
    samples with values -1.0 and +1.0 but unaware of any *sample rate*.

    We can later filter the sequence and apply emphasis. At that stage we need
    to know about sample rate but not in this class.

    This class implements:
    * Generators
    * Circular Cross Correlation
    * Extraction of the impulse response
