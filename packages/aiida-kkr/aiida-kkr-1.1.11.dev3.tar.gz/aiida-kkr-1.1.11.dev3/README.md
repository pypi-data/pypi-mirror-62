# aiida-kkr

[AiiDA](https://aiida.net) plugin for the [JÃ¼lich KKR codes](https://jukkr.fz-juelich.de) plus workflows and utility.

## Features

* KKR calculations for bulk and interfaces
* treatment of alloys using VCA or CPA
* self-consistency, DOS and bandstructure calculations
* extraction of magnetic exchange coupling parameters (*J_ij*, *D_ij*)
* impurity embedding solving the Dyson equation


# Installation

```shell
$ pip install aiida-kkr  # install latest version of aiida-kkr (published on pypi.org)
$ reentry scan -r aiida  # update entry points, needed in order to find kkr.* entrypoints in aiida

# setupt aiida if this was not done already:
$ verdi quicksetup  # better to set up a new profile
$ verdi calculation plugins  # should now show kkr.* entrypoints
```

for developer version download the repository and install the downloaded version
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-kkr.git
$ pip install -e aiida-kkr
$ reentry scan -r aiida
```
