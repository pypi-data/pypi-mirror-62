        ### Fixed
        
        issue #50 - FlowView: Map is expanded when there's only one Map in the current oid
        
        This is intended and used to be cool. But now that we have 'expanded' and 'expandable' options on Relation.ui() it is annoying.
        
        ## [2.1.9] - 2020-02-03
        
        ### Fixed
        
        issue #58 - Flow page messed up layout 
        
        Parent relations were causing horizontal alignment glitchs in FlowView
        with PyQt5 and PySide2.
        
        ### Added
        
        issue #7  - Support an "expandable" and "expanded" option on Relation.ui()
        
        issue #55 - Popup menus in Navigation bar now has Copy and Paste items.

        ### Fixed
        
        issue #51 - Could not hide a relation by setting `ui['hidden'] = True` in Ojbect._fill_ui()
        
        ## [2.1.6] - 2019-08-14
        
        ### Fixed
        
        issue #50 - GUI does not show any icon on Map fields

        ## [2.1.4] - 2019-08-09
        
        ### Added
        
        issue #12 - Dynamic UI Properties
        
        Any property set on a `Relation.ui()` can now be overridden per Object instance by overridding `Object._fill_ui(ui)`
        This has been a long request, especially to have dynamic value for the `icon` and `hidden` properties.
        
        issue #48 - Custom UI Page
        
        It is now possible to provide an arbitrary widget to display/edit an Object in the Flow view.
        
        This can be specified at the relation's level with `Relation(...).ui(custom_page='my_module.MyWidget')`.
        Or at the Object level by overridding `Object._fill_ui(ui)`.
        
        See `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.UnittestProject` "Custom Page" for details and example.
        
        ### Fixed
        
        issue #12 - When expanding a Connection relation in GUI, sub fields don't update.
        issue #12 - (correlated) When showing not-child item in DynamicMap (a.k.a Map as View), items don't update.
        
        issue #47 - Fix Map item styling consistency
        
        The `style` dict in `Map._fill_row_style` now accepts 'foreground_color' as well as 'foreground-color' etc... And
        the value may be in the form (255,255,255) as well as '#FFFFFF'
        
        ## [2.1.3] - 2019-07-15
        
        ### Fixed
        
        issue #43 - MapField summary refresh after touch().

        - Added deprecation warnings (stdout printed) for view system changes. You should update
        your code as soon as possible.

        - Added a built-in 'SessionToolBar' view with user/session/cluster info and layout preset tools.
