Description: # A simple Calculator Project
        
        In this project, i used a *Fire* to solve expressions such as BODMAS,which solves multiple operations i.e addition,subtraction,multiplication and division. Where *fire* is a Python library that will turn any Python component into a command line interface with just a single call to Fire.
        The easiest way to use *Fire* is to take any Python program, and then simply call fire.Fire() at the end of the program. This will expose the full contents of the program to the command line.
        
        **Getting Started**
        
        How to run project?
        
        1. Create a virtual environment on your local machine
        ```
        python3 -m venv env
        ```
        2. Activate virtual environment
        ```
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
        3. Make a local directory
        
        4. Clone project in your directory
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/mugdhadalal/pycalci.git
        ```
        5. Install setup.py
        ```
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        6. Use command pycalci,it will show you commands
        ```

        COMMANDS
            COMMAND is one of the following:
        
             solve
        ```
        7. use pycalci solve EXPRESSION
        ```
        $ pycalci solve 2+4*5/2
        12.0
        ```
        
        **Example**
        ```
        import fire
        
        def hello(name):
          return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name)
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
          fire.Fire()
        ```
        Here's how we can run our program from the command line:
        ```
        $ python example.py hello World
        Hello World!
        ```
