Description: # Sampling a high dimensional space under non-linear constraints.  
        Initially composed as a technical challenge for Citrine.
        
        ## Operation
        #### As a python script
        
        #### Install from PyPy
        
        
        ## Scaling and future work
        * Security considerations of `eval`. 
        * Special cases have analytic solutions (linear constraints defining a simplex)
        * The current method works best in continuous spaces. 
        * Consider limits of time and memory 
        * Improved uniformnity on sampling after certain number of steps (autocorrelation function) D. Chandler, Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics (Oxford University
