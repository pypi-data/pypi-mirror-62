# Sampling a high dimensional space under non-linear constraints.  
Initially composed as a technical challenge for Citrine.

## Operation
#### As a python script

#### Install from PyPy


## Scaling and future work
* Security considerations of `eval`. 
* Special cases have analytic solutions (linear constraints defining a simplex)
* The current method works best in continuous spaces. 
* Consider limits of time and memory 
* Improved uniformnity on sampling after certain number of steps (autocorrelation function) D. Chandler, Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics (Oxford University
