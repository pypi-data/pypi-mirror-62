# Compress-fasttext
This Python 3 package allows to compress fastText models (from the `gensim` package) by orders of magnitude, 
without seriously affecting their quality.

Use it like this:

```python
import gensim
import compress_fasttext
big_model = gensim.models.fasttext.FastTextKeyedVectors.load('path-to-original-model')
small_model = compress_fasttext.prune_ft_freq(big_model, pq=True)
small_model.save('path-to-new-model')
```

Different compression methods include:
- matrix decomposition (`svd_ft`)
- product quantization (`quantize_ft`)
- optimization of feature hashing (`prune_ft`)
- feature selection (`prune_ft_freq`)

The recommended approach is combination of feature selection and quantization 
(the function `prune_ft_freq` with `pq=True`).

This code is heavily based on the [navec](https://github.com/natasha/navec) package by Alexander Kukushkin and 
[the blogpost](https://medium.com/@vasnetsov93/shrinking-fasttext-embeddings-so-that-it-fits-google-colab-cd59ab75959e) 
by Andrey Vasnetsov about shrinking fastText embeddings.
