        Features
        --------
        
        - Adds an output filter that changes all the internal link in a page (the ones
          with `resolveuid`) to the absolute url of that plone object.
        - Adds the `ILeadImage` behavior to the Link content type so you can add an
          image to a link object.
        - If the link is internal to the site, the page template of the actual link
          (if you have the right permissions) shows the absolute url of the linked
          object.
        - If the link points to a deleted or an unpublished resource, you get redirected
          to the home page and a warning message is displayed.

        1.0.0 (2018-12-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Version bump that needed to be done in the previous release :)
          [arsenico13]

        0.2.0 (2018-12-13)
        ------------------
        
        Upgrade step required.
        
        - Removed override for Link add/edit forms
          [arsenico13]
        - Removed changes to the link schema (the 'schema' folder is still in the
          product just for avoid errors while upgrading: will be removed at the next
          version of the add-on)
          [arsenico13]
        - Removed indexers
          [arsenico13]
        - NEW: Added an output filter that changes every `resolveuid` for an internal
          link found in a page with the absolute_url of that plone object.
          [arsenico13]
        - NEW: No more 'internal_link' field. Right now, all is done with the field
          `remoteUrl` as the standard Plone Link type.
          [arsenico13]
        - link.pt: when the link is internal, the template shows the absolute url to
          the linked object. It's more human readable than the `resolveuid` link...
          [arsenico13]
