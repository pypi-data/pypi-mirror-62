0.2.0 (2018-12-13)
------------------

Upgrade step required.

- Removed override for Link add/edit forms
  [arsenico13]
- Removed changes to the link schema (the 'schema' folder is still in the
  product just for avoid errors while upgrading: will be removed at the next
  version of the add-on)
  [arsenico13]
- Removed indexers
  [arsenico13]
- NEW: Added an output filter that changes every `resolveuid` for an internal
  link found in a page with the absolute_url of that plone object.
  [arsenico13]
- NEW: No more 'internal_link' field. Right now, all is done with the field
  `remoteUrl` as the standard Plone Link type.
  [arsenico13]
- link.pt: when the link is internal, the template shows the absolute url to
  the linked object. It's more human readable than the `resolveuid` link...
