Features
--------

- Adds an output filter that changes all the internal link in a page (the ones
  with `resolveuid`) to the absolute url of that plone object.
- Adds the `ILeadImage` behavior to the Link content type so you can add an
  image to a link object.
- If the link is internal to the site, the page template of the actual link
  (if you have the right permissions) shows the absolute url of the linked
  object.
- If the link points to a deleted or an unpublished resource, you get redirected
  to the home page and a warning message is displayed.
