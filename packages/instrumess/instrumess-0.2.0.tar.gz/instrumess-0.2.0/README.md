Instrumess is an instrument driver library 
It is aimed at PhDs in photonics who are comfortable with developing python code
It is developed by Rastko PajkoviÄ‡ at TU/e
It serves a secondary purpose to document all Python code during PhD
It will remain as simple as possible

To install just 'pip install instrumess'

To install the latest version and contribute clone the git repository
and install it in the editable mode with 'pip install -e <git-repo-local>'
