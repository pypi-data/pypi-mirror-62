# Description

This package is one of the implementation available in the fsspec module. It can be used alone, with fsspec, dask or intake by indicating the  protocol in the path file:
```
dropbox://file_path
```

Be careful: There are for the moment at least no unity/integration tests on this implementation (alpha version).

It can also be used directly from the fsspec module to download and upload files in the github account.

The upload part is using the dropbox API.

The download part is using the dropbox API to create a temporary link and then used the already existing https implementation.
Caching (see fsspec module) is available in that case.

The documentation of the fsspec module can be found [here.](https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/blob/master/docs/source/features.rst)

It has also been tested as compatible with [Intake module.](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/MarineChap/dropboxdrivefs) in case of bugs or just to indicate your use-case. 

## Install

```
pip install dropboxdrivefs
```
