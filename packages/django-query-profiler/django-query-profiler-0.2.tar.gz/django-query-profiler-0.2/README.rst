This project implements a query profiler for django projects. It tries to answer the question
"My Django page or API is slow, How do I find out why?".  It highlights all code paths that make N+1 calls to the
database, and also provide recommendation to developers on how N+1 can be fixed

This image shows the profiler in action:
