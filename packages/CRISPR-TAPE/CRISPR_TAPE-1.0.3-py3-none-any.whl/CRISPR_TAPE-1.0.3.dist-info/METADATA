Existing CRIPSR gRNA design tools target protein-coding regions within genomic loci and non-specifically target the entire input region of DNA. Current tools fail to consider proteomic-based applications, so CRISPR-TAPE has been developed to reduce the substantial time burden associated with manual curation of gRNA libraries and empower the proteomics community.
