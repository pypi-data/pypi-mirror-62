There are a lot of portals in the internet with content to explore and
exercises for self check. It is obvious that the internet
has still huge potentials in teaching and learning. 

Mamchecker is yet another approach.

The main purpose:

- Automatically correct exercises

- Infrastructure to organize teaching hierarchies (school, period, teacher, class, student)

- allow teachers to quickly check the exercises of students

- The use is of course not confined to schools. At universities, in private coaching, 
  for autodidacts and companies, ... there are possible applications for Mamchecker.

  Teachers, professors, tutors, coaches, students, autodidacts, ... 
  can add exercises.

- Share exercise via `github <https://github.com>`_.

- Exercise numbers are randomly generated. This way an exercise can be reused.
  Students sitting next to each others in class will have different numbers and
  therefore cannot copy the results.

- Provide exercises to learners who want to check their understanding.

Mamchecker can be used remotely as well as in class.

In class students can use the browser on their smartphones to answer exercises.
Teachers can immediately see, who answered correctly or who has not yet answered.

This way the teacher is faster to find
those students who have not yet memorized something 
or have not yet understood a concept or a relationship.

Students can do exercises immediately after the teacher's explanation in class in the
same lesson. This way the students

- need to pay attention, because they will have to know immediately afterwards

- have no time to copy from others as some do with exercises only due in the
  next lesson

- do not need to admit that they have not understood, 
  because the teacher sees, if they are unable to do the exercise.
  Some students are too shy to ask. And there are other reasons,
  why student's incomprehension can stay unnoticed for too long.

The teacher cannot look at all the exercises of a class at the same time, 
but the software can.

To do it sequentially in class would hold up the students. 
If the teacher takes the exercises home
there is an unwanted delay in feedback for the students.

More parallelism in class is very important in order to make the time spent
there by the students worthwhile.

The time spent by a teacher to correct exercise is also
better invested in a good preparation: 

- how to motivate the students

- how to present the topic as easy as possible

- which questions to ask to practice and verify that the students have understood
