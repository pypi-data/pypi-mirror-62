As I was about to engage in a teaching job in the beginning of 2013 I was
looking for a way adequate for our times

- to follow the progress of my students
- to automate certain activities

I did not find a finished solution fitting to my ideas,
but I found Google Appengine, which seemed to be a good basis for an own project.

During my teaching job it was still in a very unsophisticated state,
but it was usable already. During that time I added mostly exercises, some summaries
or other texts that did fit into the topics in class.

The name came about from this school's abbreviation of the subject mathematics as MAM.

Since summer 2013 I restructured the code and added user management 
and I translated the exercises and texts into English.

Since in autumn I did not continue teaching,
my major motivation for the additional effort was to make my initial effort
usable for others. 

So I hope 

- that other do agree with the basic idea and approach 

- that learners as well as teachers find the existing implementation usable

- and that they use it and extend it
