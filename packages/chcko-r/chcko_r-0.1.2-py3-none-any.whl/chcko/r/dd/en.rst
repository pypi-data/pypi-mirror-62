In order to try, you as a teacher and the students do not necessarily need to register.

Step-by-step for everybody in class:

- Think of IDs for School, Period, Teacher, Class and every Student.
  The IDs must fit together, i.e. all students have the same ID for class, teacher, ...

- First the teacher, then the students do:

    - open http://mamchecker.appspot.com/en
    - Go to ``edits`` (top left) 
    - Enter the IDs. The teacher is a student, too, but he can also leave the
      student field empty.
    - Press [OK].

- All students do an exercise (e.g. enter ``/en/r.bu`` in the address line).

- The teacher enters the URL ``/<lang>/done?<classId>&*&*`` 
  to see if everybody was successful.
  From right to left this means: 
  
    - any problem (``*``)
    - of any student (``*``)
    - of the class ``<classID>``. The actual class ID must be used.

Difference to registered users: 
If unregistered every student can play teacher and give assignments
or query exercise results (see :lnk:`r.de`).
