    For making binned images and mc_infos, which can be used for conv. nets.

    Can also add statistics of the binning to the h5 files, which can
    be plotted to show the distribution of hits among the bins and how
    many hits were cut off.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_statusbar : int, optional
        Print a statusbar every n blobs.
    n_memory_observer : int, optional
        Print memory usage every n blobs.
    complib : str
        Compression library used for saving the output to a .h5 file.
        All PyTables compression filters are available, e.g. 'zlib',
        'lzf', 'blosc', ... .
    complevel : int
        Compression level for the compression filter that is used for
        saving the output to a .h5 file.
    flush_frequency : int
        After how many events the accumulated output should be flushed to
        the harddisk.
        A larger value leads to a faster orcasong execution,
        but it increases the RAM usage as well.
    bin_plot_freq : int or None
        If int is given, defines after how many blobs data for an overview
        histogram is extracted.
        It shows the distribution of hits, the bin edges, and how many hits
        were cut off for each field name in bin_edges_list.
        It will be saved to the same path as the outfile in run.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bin_edges_list : List
            List with the names of the fields to bin, and the respective bin
            edges, including the left- and right-most bin edge.
            Example: For 10 bins in the z direction, and 100 bins in time:
                bin_edges_list = [
                    ["pos_z", np.linspace(0, 10, 11)],
                    ["time", np.linspace(-50, 550, 101)],
                ]
            Some examples can be found in orcasong.bin_edges.
        mc_info_extr : function, optional
            Function that extracts desired mc_info from a blob, which is then
            stored as the "y" datafield in the .h5 file.
            The function takes the km3pipe blob as an input, and returns
            a dict mapping str to floats.
            Some examples can be found in orcasong.mc_info_extr.
        det_file : str, optional
            Path to a .detx detector geometry file, which can be used to
            calibrate the hits.
        center_time : bool
            Subtract time of first triggered hit from all hit times. Will
            also be done for McHits if they are in the blob [default: True].
        event_skipper : func, optional
            Function that takes the blob as an input, and returns a bool.
            If the bool is true, the blob will be skipped.
            This is placed after the binning and mc_info extractor.
        add_bin_stats : bool
            Add statistics of the binning to the output file. They can be
            plotted with util/bin_stats_plot.py [default: True].
        chunksize : int
            Chunksize (along axis_0) used for saving the output
            to a .h5 file [default: 32].
        keep_event_info : bool
            If True, will keep the "event_info" table [default: True].
        keep_mc_tracks : bool
            If True, will keep the "McTracks" table [default: False].
        add_t0 : bool
            If true, add t0 to the time of hits and mchits. If using a
            det_file, this will already have been done automatically.
            Note: Mchits appear to NOT need t0 added, but its done auto-
            matically by km3pipe calibration, so results might be
            wrong for mchits. [default: False].
        hit_weights : str, optional
            Use blob["Hits"][hit_weights] as weights for samples in histogram.
