        *Generates iCal files for class schedules for schools using an N-day cycle*
        
        If you're a teacher or a student, you probably have a 6 or 7-day cycle.
        You'd like to enter your schedule into your calendar, but calendar software doesn't support "recur every n weekdays".
        So you're out of luck, right? That's where Cycle Calendar Generator comes in.
        You just need to make an Excel file with your school's schedule, and another Excel file for each teacher/student's schedule, and Cycle Calendar Generator does the rest.

        Installation
        ------------
        
                ``$ pip install cycle_calendar_generator``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Make a "Schedule Setup" Excel file
            a. Filename must be schedule_setup.xlsx
            b. Has 3 sheets, named "Period Timing", "Cycle Days List", and "Yearly Schedule"
            c. "Period Timing" sheet gives the period name/number, start time, and end time for each period
            d. "Cycle Days List" sheet lists the name/number of each day in the cycle
            e. "Yearly Schedule" sheet lists all dates in the school year and the matching day in the cycle
            f. Dates and times should be in the standard Excel date/time format
            g. All other data should be in text format, including numbers.
            h. See below for examples
        2. Make an Excel file for each user that wants a schedule calendar
            a. The filename should match the user's name, and will be used to name the output calendar file. (Ex. Eric Idle's Excel file should be named "Eric Idle.xlsx", and  will generate "Eric Idle.ics")
            b. Has 1 sheet, named "User Schedule", that has the user's usual schedule for a cycle
            c. All data here should be in text format
            d. See below for examples
        3. Put all files in any folder
        4. Run the application as follows:
        
                ``$ cycle_calendar_generator path/to/schedule/files``
        
        5. Schedule iCal files are found in the /output folder under the folder with your input Excel files.

        Tests
        -----
        
        For current Python version:
                ``python3 setup.py test``
        
        For versions 3.5+
                ``tox``
        
        It's recommended to use pyenv_ to install Python versions required by tox.
        pyenv can be installed using Homebrew_::
        
                brew update
                brew install pyenv
                pyenv install 3.6.6 3.7.6
        
        .. _pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
        .. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh/

        Excel file reading was made possible by the openpyxl_ package, while iCal file reading and writing uses the ics_ package.
