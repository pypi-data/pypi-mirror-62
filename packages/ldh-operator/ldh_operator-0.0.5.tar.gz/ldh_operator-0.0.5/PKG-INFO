        *Whipstaff* is a command-line tool for operating one or more Liberty
        Deckplan Hosts (LDHs) from your local session. The reference
        implementation for an LDH operator toolkit.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The preferred way to install Whipstaff is with your package manager.
        The recommended package name is `ldh-operator`. For example:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install ldh-operator # Debian-based
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        pipx install ldh-operator # Python-based
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        For help and a list of available commands:
        
        ```bash
        whipstaff --help
        ```
        
        ## Installation (from source)
        
        If you'd prefer to run from source...
        
        1. Install Python 3.x and pipenv. (See
           <https://docs.pipenv.org/install/> for a tutorial.)
        
        2. Get source:
        
                git clone https://source.puri.sm/liberty/tool/operator.git ldh_operator_toolkit
        
        3. Install with pipenv:
        
                cd ldh_operator_toolkit
                pipenv install --dev -e .
        
        ## Usage (from source)
        
        ```bash
        cd ldh_operator_toolkit
        pipenv run whipstaff --help
        # using "pipenv run" avoids confusion with a regular installation
        ```
        
        ## Build wheel package (and optionally upload)
        
        Follow these instructions to build Liberty CLI as a Python package:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://source.puri.sm/liberty/tool/operator.git ldh_operator_toolkit
        cd ldh_operator_toolkit
        pipenv install --dev
        pipenv shell
        # optionally edit default.yaml
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        If everything works as expected you should end up with the files:
        
        * `dist/ldh_operator-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`
        * `dist/ldh_operator-<version>.tar.gz`
        
        You can now optionally upload the created Python package to PyPI using twine:
        
        ```bash
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
