type_extensions
===============

Importable mixin methods for Python.


Description
===========

The ``type_extensions`` package defines decorators that make it possible to define typed
extension methods outside the original class definition in a separate module. The
methods defined by a ``type_extension`` module may be imported and used in other modules
without polluting the the original class definition for other modules.
