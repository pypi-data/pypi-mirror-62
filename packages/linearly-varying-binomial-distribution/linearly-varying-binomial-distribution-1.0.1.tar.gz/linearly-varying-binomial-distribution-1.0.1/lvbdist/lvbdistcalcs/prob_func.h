/*
    the linearly increasing probability in the
    binomial-like distribution problem

    one can flip a card. there is a probability [base_prob] to have a good one at the beginning.
    if one does not have the good one for some attempts in a row, the constant will be added
    to the existing probability (so that the chance of having the good one is increasing) until
    one finally has the good card, at which point the chance will reset to the original one.

    for some computed results see function_tests.c
