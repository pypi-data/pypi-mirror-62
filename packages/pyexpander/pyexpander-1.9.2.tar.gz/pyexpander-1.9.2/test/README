This directory contains a number of tests of pyexpander.

Test with:

PYVER=3 make clean
PYVER=3 make

Make does run the doctest testcode in expanderparser.py and pyexpander.py and
then runs several tests by calling expander.py. Each time, expander.py is
applied to an input file, usually test[nn].in, it's output is written to
test[nn].out. This is then compared to test[nn].ok. If there is a difference,
the test has failed.
