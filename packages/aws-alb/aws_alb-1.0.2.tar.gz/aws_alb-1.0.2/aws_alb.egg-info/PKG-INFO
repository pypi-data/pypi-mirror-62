Description: ## AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)
        
        An abstract application loadbalancer construct. It creates a loadbalancer and default
        security groups and listeners for the loadbalancer. Also, this loadbalancer is ready
        for blue-green deployments.
        
        #### Remarks
        
        The project is written by [Laimonas Sutkus](https://github.com/laimonassutkus) 
        and is owned by [iDenfy](https://github.com/idenfy). This is an open source
        library intended to be used by anyone. [iDenfy](https://github.com/idenfy) aims
        to share its knowledge and educate market for better and more secure IT infrastructure.
        
        #### Related technology
        
        This project utilizes the following technology:
        
        - *AWS* (Amazon Web Services).
        - *AWS CDK* (Amazon Web Services Cloud Development Kit).
        - *AWS CloudFormation*.
        - *AWS Loadbalancer*.
        - *AWS Security groups*.
        
        #### Assumptions
        
        This library project assumes the following:
        
        - You have knowledge in AWS (Amazon Web Services).
        - You have knowledge in AWS CloudFormation and AWS loadbalancing.
        - You are managing your infrastructure with AWS CDK.
        - You are writing AWS CDK templates with a python language.
        
        #### Install
        
        The project is built and uploaded to PyPi. Install it by using pip.
        
        ```bash
        pip install aws-alb
        ```
        
        Or directly install it through source.
        
        ```bash
        ./build.sh -ic
        ```
        
        #### Description
        
        It is usually hard to create a loadbalancer following best practices and rules. Also, most of the 
        time the deployed loadbalancer will lack some configuration functionality for deployment management.
        We tackle these problems by providing you a library to easily deploy and maintain a loadbalancer with
        right security groups, right listeners and most importantly right configuration for blue-green deployments.
        
        #### Examples
        
        To create an application loadbalancer create an `ApplicationLoadbalancer`
        instance in your stack. An example is given below:
        
        ```python
        from aws_cdk import core, aws_ec2
        from aws_alb.alb_traffic_enum import AlbTrafficEnum
        from aws_alb.application_loadbalancer import ApplicationLoadbalancer
        
        class MainStack(core.Stack):
            def __init__(self, scope: core.App) -> None:
                super().__init__(
                    scope=scope,
                    id='MyCoolStack'
                )
                
                # Create your own vpc.
                self.vpc = aws_ec2.Vpc(
                    self,
                    'MyCoolVpc'
                )
        
                self.public_http_loadbalancer = ApplicationLoadbalancer(
                    scope=self,
                    prefix='MyCool',
                    vpc=self.vpc,
                    loadbalancer_subnets=self.vpc.public_subnets,
                    security_groups=None,
                    inbound_traffic=AlbTrafficEnum.INTERNET,
                    outbound_traffic=AlbTrafficEnum.INTERNET,
                    certificate=None
                )
        ```
