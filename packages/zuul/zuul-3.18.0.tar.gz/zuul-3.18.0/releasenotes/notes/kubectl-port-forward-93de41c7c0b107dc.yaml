upgrade:
  - |
    Kubectl and socat must now be installed on Zuul executors if using
    Kubernetes or OpenShift `pod` resources from Nodepool.  Additionally,
    Nodepool version 3.12.0 or later is required.
fixes:
  - |
    Previously, no output from shell or command tasks on pods was placed
    in the job output; that has been corrected and streaming output is
    now available.
