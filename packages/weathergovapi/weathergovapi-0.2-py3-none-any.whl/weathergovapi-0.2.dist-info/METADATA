# Weather API

This is a very simple library to access information from the weather.gov api.

```python
>>> from weathergovapi import WeatherGovApi
>>> point = WeatherGovApi.getPoint(31.9383,-81.3034)
# Information from the API can be accessed directly
>>> point.forecastUrl
'https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/CHS/39,33/forecast'
# There are a few convenience methods
>>> forecast = point.forecast()
>>> current = forecast.periods[0]
>>> current.detailedForecast
