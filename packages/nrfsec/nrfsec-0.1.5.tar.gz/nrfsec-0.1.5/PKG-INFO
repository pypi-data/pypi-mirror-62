Description: 
        # nrfsec 
        
        nrfsec is security research tool used for unlocking and reading memory on nrf51 series SoCs from Nordic Semiconductor. 
        
          - Read all target memory, bypassing the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) settings with integrated read gadget searching
          - Automated unlock feature: read all program and UICR memory, erase all memory, patch UICR image, relash target into unlocked state
          - boot delay command flag for interacting with target prior to performing memory read, allow for RAM dumps
          - All firmware images are saved for importing into your favorite disassembler 
        
        ### Installation
        
        nrfsec is built on the [pyswd library](https://github.com/cortexm/pyswd/) and currently only works with the [ST-Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2548) debugging interface.
        
        nrfsec requires python 3.7+ to run and can be installed with pip
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install nrfsec
        ```
        
        
        
        ### Todos
        
         - Test on moar targets
