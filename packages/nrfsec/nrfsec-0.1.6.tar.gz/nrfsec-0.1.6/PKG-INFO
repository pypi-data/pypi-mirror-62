Description: # nrfsec 
        
        nrfsec is security research tool used for unlocking and reading memory on nrf51 series SoCs from Nordic Semiconductor. 
        
          - Read all target memory, bypassing the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) settings with integrated read gadget searching
          - Automated unlock feature: read all program and UICR memory, erase all memory, patch UICR image, reflash target into unlocked state
          - boot delay command flag for interacting with target prior to performing memory read, allow for RAM dumps
          - All firmware images are saved for importing into your favorite disassembler 
        
        ### Installation
        
        nrfsec is built on the [pyswd library](https://github.com/cortexm/pyswd/) and currently only works with the [ST-Link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2548) debugging interface.
        
        nrfsec requires python 3.7+ to run and can be installed with pip
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install nrfsec
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        ```sh
        âœ— nrfsec -h
        usage: nrfsec <command> [<args>]
        
        perform security related tasks on nRF51 targets through SWD interface
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                                frequency to run the SWD interface (default 4 MHz)
          -v, --verbose         increase output verobsity
        
        supported subcommands:
          {info,erase,restore,read,unlock,lock}
            info                display chip information
            erase               perform a complete erase
            restore             restore specific images to an unlocked chip
            read                read memory contents to outfile
            unlock              unlock the device if locked
            lock                lock the device if unlocked
        ```
        
        ### Todos
        
         - Test on moar targets
