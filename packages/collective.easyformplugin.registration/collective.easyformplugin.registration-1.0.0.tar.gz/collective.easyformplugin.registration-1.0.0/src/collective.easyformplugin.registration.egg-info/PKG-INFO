        Collective Easyform: Registration plugin
        ========================================
        
        Plugin for collective.easyform that allows to manage a subscription form.
        
        With this product installed, when you create a new **Easyform** content-type, there will be a new "Registration" tab in edit form.
        
        You can set the max number of attendees, a waiting list and open and close dates.
        
        Subscription logic
        ------------------
        
        Users can subscribe to the form if:
        
        - Current date is between open and close date
        - There are still available slots
        - Available slots are full but there is a waiting list
        
        Contact registrants
        -------------------
        
        You can send messages to registrants (and waiting list) to keep them updated.
