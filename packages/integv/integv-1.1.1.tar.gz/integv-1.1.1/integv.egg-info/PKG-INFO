         integv is a file integrity verifier based on the format of the file. It's 
         capable of checking the integrity of multiple types of files without any 
         additional information like Content-Length or checksum. The main goal of integv
         is to detect file corruption (mostly shortened) during file download caused by 
         network glitch. But integv still can be used for many other purposes as well.
         
         # Installation
         ```bash
        pip install integv
        ```
         
         # Quick Start
         ```python
        import integv
        
        # load a test mp4 file
        file_path = "./test/sample/video/sample.mp4"
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            file = f.read()
        
        # initiate a verifier
        verifier = integv.FileIntegrityVerifier()
        
        # verify using the file and file_type
        # file_type can be a simple filename extension like "mp4" or "jpg"
        # or you can provide a full MIME type like "video/mp4" or "image/jpeg"
        verifier.verify(file, file_type="mp4") # True
        
        # a corrupted file (in this case, shortened by one byte) will not pass the verification
        verifier.verify(file[:-1], file_type="mp4") # False
        
        # the file input for the verifier can be bytes or a binary file like object
        verifier.verify(open(file_path, "rb"), file_type="mp4") # True
        
        # it can also be a string representing a file path
        # if the file path contains a proper filename extension, the file_type is not needed.
        verifier.verify(file_path) # True
        ```
        
        # Supported types
        
        ### Video
        
        * **mp4:** `video/mp4`
        * **mkv:** `video/x-matroska`
        * **webm:** `video/webm`
        * **avi:** `video/vnd.avi`
        
        ### Image
        
        * **jpeg:** `image/jpeg`
        * **png:** `image/png`
        * **gif:** `image/gif`
        * **webp** `image/webp`
        
        ### Audio
        
        * **wav:** `audio/x-wav`
        * **ogg:** `audio/ogg`
        
        # Limitation of integv
        The integv verifier only checks the file by the format information embedded in 
        file like file size in header, chuck size in chuck header, end of file markers,
        etc. It does not try to decode the file which makes integv fast and simple.
        But that also means the possibility of false negative (corrupted files can't be 
        detected). The baseline of all integv file integrity verifiers must be extremely 
        sensitive to shortened files, which is very common in file downloaded from the
        network. Some types of files like png contain checksum inside, which is less
        error-prone. By all means, do not use integv for any kind of security 
        verification. As a bad file which passes the verification can be simply forged.
        
        
        # Advanced Usage
        ## Specialized File Integrity Verifier
        There are some specialized file integrity verifier for different types of files.
        You can find them in `integv.video`, `integv.image` and `integv.audio`. They are
        used exactly like the `FileIntegrityVerifier` except `file_type` are not needed.
        
        ```python
        from integv.video import MP4IntegrityVerifier
        
        verifier = MP4IntegrityVerifier()
        verifier.verify("./test/sample/video/sample.mp4") # True
        ```
        
        ## Optional `slow` argument in verifier initialization
        A boolean argument `slow` can be provided in verifier initialization. It will 
        enable some sophisticated verification to eliminate false negatives. And that 
        will consume more time. The default value of `slow` is `False`. For now, only 
        one verifier, `OGGIntegrityVerifier` has a `slow` method of verification. 
        
        ```python
        from integv import FileIntegrityVerifier
        
        verifier = FileIntegrityVerifier()
        slow_verifier = FileIntegrityVerifier(slow=True)
        
        file_path = "./test/sample/audio/sample.ogg"
        verifier.verify(file_path) # True
        slow_verifier.verify(file_path) # also True, but slower
        
        ```
