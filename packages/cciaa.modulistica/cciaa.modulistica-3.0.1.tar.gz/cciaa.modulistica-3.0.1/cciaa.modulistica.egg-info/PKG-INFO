        Introduction
        ============
        
        The italian word `modulistica`__ means "*documentation*", "*downloadable forms*". 
        
        __ http://www.wordreference.com/iten/modulistica
        
        This product adds the following features to your Plone folders:
        
        * a new view ("*Downloadable forms view*") to display files in the folder
        * a new field, where you can enter a set of column names, used in the view
        
        This product has been designed for public administration offices, but can be used from any other company that
        needs to display a large amount of files that can be downloaded from visitors. 
        
        How to use the view
        ===================
        
        This view will simply show in a table all files and links in the folder, ignoring all other
        stuff.
        
        Files are displayed in a two-column table.

           :alt: Simple view, without related items
        
        You can optionally use a new field of the folder called *Columns titles* to control the heading of the table.
        If you don't provide a value for this field, no heading will be used. Please note that the field is only
        displayed when the view is applied to the folder
        
        Related items of files
        ----------------------
        
        If files have related items, they are used to expand the table with more columns. This features is
        mainly used for giving secondary, alternative format for a downloadale document.

           :alt: Main files with secondary ones
        
        Keep in mind that:
        
        * related items of Link content type are ignored
        * only related items of type File or Link are used
        
        Pages
        -----
        
        In facts the view also use Pages inside the folder, but for a special use case.
        
        Pages are loaded, and the body content is inserted inside a wide table header row. This can be useful if you
        need to comment a subset of files.
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/cciaa.modulistica-2.0.0-03.png
           :alt: Table with comments
        
        You can use this feature for simple comment inside the table, or for provide a complex structure:
