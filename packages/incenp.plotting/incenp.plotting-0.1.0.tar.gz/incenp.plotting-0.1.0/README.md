Incenp.plotting - Incenp.orgÂ´s plotting helper library
======================================================

Incenp.plotting, also called *pyplot* (but *incenp.plotting* is
preferred as it less likely to clash with another Python package) is a
Python library providing helper functions to facilitate the creation of
special kinds of plots with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

Available modules
-----------------

- `incenp.plotting.bar`: Provides a *barplot* function to create bar
  plots from a multi-indexed [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data
  frame.
- `incenp.plotting.scatter`: Provides a *scatterplot* function to
  create scatter plots from a multi-indexed Pandas data frame.
- `incenp.plotting.util`: Helper functions used in the other modules,
  but which can also be used directly. This module provides notably a
  *xdistr* function to facilitate creating scatter plots.
