This empty directory is automatically added to Windows PATH variable, so it's a convenient place to put all the auxiliary programs PyCirkuit needs to compile its documents, namely:

 * m4.exe
 * dpic.exe
 * pdftoppm.exe

(At present, these programs have to be manually downloaded and installed by the user)
