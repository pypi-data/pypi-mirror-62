Description: # QRConsole
        A library to display QR codes in console.
        
        ## Requirements
        **Pillow>=7.0.0** - Download using `python` or `python3 -m pip install "Pillow>=7.0.0"`
        
        ## Installation
        ### PyPI
        To get the module through PyPi: `pip install qrconsole`.  
        ### GitHub (Pulled Repo)
        To install the module by pulling the repo: `python setup.py install`.  
        
        ## How to use
        QRConsole is pretty straight-forward. Provide an image, and it will return a string with the console-ified version.  
        The image provided must be black-and-white. If there are greys, they will be turned into white or black depending on which they are closer to.  
        A good site for creation is [this one](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/), since there is no rounding or styling, just b&w pixels.  
        **It is recommended to keep the images as small as possible, since every pixel of the image is two characters in the console. The example image is 65x65 px.**  
        
        ## Use
        1. Initialize
        ```python
        from qrconsole import QRConsole
        qr = QRConsole(char="@") # char = The character to use for white in the QR Code. Must have a length of 1.
        ```
        2. Console-ify image
        ```python
        print(qr.consoleify(qr_img="example_code.png")) # qr_img = The path to the QR Code image.
        ```
