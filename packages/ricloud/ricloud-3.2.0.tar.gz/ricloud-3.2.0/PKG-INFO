        This is the Python client for *ricloud*, Reincubate's [Cloud Data API](https://reincubate.com/labs/icloud-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud).
        
        > Refer to the comprehensive *ricloud* [documentation](https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud-v3/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud) for a fuller picture of the API's capabilities, specifications, and benefits. See also the [Apple iCloud service](https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud/icloud-backups/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud) documentation for its rich capabilities in accessing iCloud data.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The library can be installed with a single command:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install ricloud
        ```
        
        Note the version is specified explicitly above, that is because this version is currently in beta.
        
        ## Usage
        
        A sample script is included which provides an example of how the API can be used to access a range of datatypes in a way that is compatible with Apple's 2FA mechanism.
        
        Before you can start using the API you will need to get setup with an access token. More details on getting started with the API can be found [in the docs](https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud-v3/getting-started/#getting-started).
        
        To run the sample script in interactive mode, execute the following command:
        
        ```bash
        $ ricloud samples icloud john.appleseed@reincubate.com
        ```
        
        More details on how to use the *ricloud-py* client can be found in [our docs](https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud-v3/ricloud-py/).
        
        ## Troubleshooting
