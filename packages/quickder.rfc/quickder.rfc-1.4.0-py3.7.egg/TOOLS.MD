# Quick DER Tools

> *Quick DER is a mixture of tools, libraries and precompiled ASN.1 specifications.*

The following tools are available:

  * `asn2quickder` to parse an ASN.1 specification, and map each to a C header file or Python module.

  * `asn1literate` to extract ASN.1 from Markdown code fragments.

  * `derdump` to view DER files.
