        Ideally, in Python all you would do to use ASN.1 from a
        given standard would be something like
        
        ```
        from quickder.rfc import rfc4511
        ```
        
        Similarly, in C all you would do to use the same standard
        would be
        
        ```
        #include <quickder/rfc4511>
        ```
        
        The Quick DER package offers just that.  It comes with
        packages like `quickder.rfc` for Python and `quickder-rfc`
        for C.  In both cases a namespace for specifications
        surrounds the information.  Multiple packages can add
        their pre-compiled things here.
        
        Have a look in the [rfc directory](rfc/) for an idea
        of how this is done.
