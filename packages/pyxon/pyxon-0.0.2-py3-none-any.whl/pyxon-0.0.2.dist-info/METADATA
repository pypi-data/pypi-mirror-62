# Pyxon

_Inspired by [Axon](https://axoniq.io/) (Java)_

Based on architectural principles, such as Domain Driven Design (DDD)
and Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Pyxon Framework 
provides the building blocks that CQRS requires and helps to create 
scalable and extensible applications while maintaining application 
consistency in distributed systems.
