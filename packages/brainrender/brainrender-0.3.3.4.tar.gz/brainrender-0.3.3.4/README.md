# BrainRender
`brainrender` is a python package for the visualization of three dimensional anatomical data from mice brains registered to the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) from the Allen Institute. Check the [user guide](Docs/UserGuide.md) and the [examples](Examples) notebooks for more information on how to use BrainRender.

# Installation
To install `brainrender`, use an existing python environment or create one [with `python < 3.8`] and install with:
```
pip install brainrender
```

# Resources
`brainrender` can be used to download and visualize anatomical data from publicly available datasets. 
These include the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, the Allen Mouse Connectome project and neuronal morphological data from the MouseLight project from Janelia. 

### Allen Mouse Brain Atlas
Anatomical and projection data is downloaded from the  Allen Brain Atlas [reference atlas](http://atlas.brain-map.org)
and [connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org) using the Allen [API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI)
(Â© 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Brain Atlas API. Available from: [brain-map.org/api/index.html](brain-map.org/api/index.html)) ([1], [2]).

An interactive, in-browser 3D structure viewer, the Allen Brain Explorer, is available [here](http://connectivity.brain-map.org/3d-viewer?v=1). 

`brainrender` can be used to visualize the 3D structure of brain regions:

and afferent anatomical projections from the Mouse Connectome project:

### Streamlines
Efferent anatomical projections [as determined by local injections of an anterogradely transported virus (see [Allen's connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org))] can be rendered as 'streamlines'.

Streamlines reconstructions are made by [https://neuroinformatics.nl](https://neuroinformatics.nl) using the mouse connectome data from Allen (see [here](https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/allen-connectivity-viewer/streamline-downloader.html) for more details).

### Mouselight neurons morphology
Neurons morphological data is from Janelia's [mouse light](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight) database
(see the [neurons browser](http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org)). [3]

## 3D rendering in python
To create 3D renderings `brainrender` relies on [vtkplotter](https://vtkplotter.embl.es) [see [github repo](https://github.com/marcomusy/vtkPlotter)], a python package for 3D visualization.

`brainrender` leverages the flexibility in specifying the look of rendered objects afforded by `vtkplotter` to let users create the look they need for high-quality scientific figures and illustrations. Examples of this are displayed throught the 
[examples](Examples), but one easy way is to set `brainrender`'s rendering style to `cartoon` to get accurate schematics of brain region's anatomy to use for figures:

### Making figures
Thanks to `vtkplotter`, `brainrender` can be used to render 3d objects loaded from `.obj` and `.stl` files, making it easy to add objects to a rendering (e.g. implanted electrodes arrays) for creating illustrations. Additionally, `brainrender` has some functions that can be used to render commonly used items such as optic cannullas (e.g. for optogenetics) and electrods arrays:
