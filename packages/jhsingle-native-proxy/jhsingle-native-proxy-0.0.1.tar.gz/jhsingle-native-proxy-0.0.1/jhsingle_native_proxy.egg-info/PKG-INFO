Description: # jhsingle-native-proxy
        
        Wrap an arbitrary webapp so it can be used in place of jupyter-singleuser in a JupyterHub setting.
        
        Within JupyterHub this allows similar operation to [jupyter-server-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy) except it also removes the Jupyter notebook itself, so is working directly with the arbitrary web service.
        
        
        This is a very basic alpha version.
        
        ## Install and Run
        
        Install using pip.
        
        ```
        pip install jhsingle-native-proxy
        ```
        
        The process to start is specified on the command line, for example a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web app:
        
        ```
        jhsingle-native-proxy streamlit hello
        ```
        
        By default the jhsingle-native-proxy server will listen on port 8888, forwarding to port 8500.
        
        But you will normally need to tell jhsingle-native-proxy which port the end process will run in, and maybe tell the 
        end process which port you want it to use (which you can do with the substitution variable {port}).
        
        Note the use of -- to signal the end of command line options to jhsingle-native-proxy. Then the third party command line 
        itself can contain options starting with dashes: 
        
        ```
        jhsingle-native-proxy -- streamlit hello --server.port {port} --server.headless True --server.enableCORS False
        ```
        
        To run jhsingle-native-proxy itself listening on a different port use:
        
        ```
        jhsingle-native-proxy --serverport 8000 streamlit hello
        ```
        
        To run jhsingle-native-proxy on port 8000, and the end process on 8505:
        
        ```
        jhsingle-native-proxy --serverport 8000 --port 8505 -- streamlit hello --server.port {port} --server.headless True --server.enableCORS False
        ```
        
        ## Development install
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ideonate/jhsingle-native-proxy.git
        cd jhsingle-native-proxy
        
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        To run directly in python: `python -m jhsingle_native_proxy.main <rest of command line>`
