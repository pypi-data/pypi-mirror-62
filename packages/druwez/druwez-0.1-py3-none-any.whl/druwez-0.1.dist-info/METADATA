`Druwez <https://www.florian-diesch.de/software/druwez/>`__ is a GTK based graphical printing tool written in Python.

With Druwez you can use drag & drop or the clipboard to print multiple
files at once from the file manager without opening any dedicated
applications.

You can optionally save print jobs to print them later (again). Only
the file names but not the file content are saved in that case so you
don't need much disk space.

Druwez itself can handle PDF, PNG, JPEG and SVG files. To print other
file formats you can define converters. A converter is a shell command
that reads a file and writes PDF, PNG, JPEG or SVG data to standard
output. For each converter you define shell patters for the files it
should convert.

By default Druwez use `unoconv
<http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/>`_ as converter for various
office file formats and `Ghostscript <https://www.ghostscript.com/>`_
for PostScript files.

Druwez works on Linux and other Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

Requirements
============

* Python >= 3.6
* Python3 setuptools
* Python3 bindings for GObject introspection libraries
* GObject introspection data for GLib, GObject, Gdk, Gdk Pixbuf, Gtk,
  Gio and Poppler
* GTK >= 3.20

The following programs are used by the default configuration as
converters. You can use Druwez without them if you don't need to print those file types or want to define your own converters.

* `unoconv <http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/>`_ is used by
  default as converter for various office file format
* `Ghostscript <https://www.ghostscript.com/>`_ is used by default as
    converter for Posrscript files

Debian-based distros
--------------------

On Debian-based distros Druwez needs the following packages:

   python3-gi, python3-pkg-resources, gir1.2-glib-2.0,
   gir1.2-gtk-3.0, gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0, gir1.2-poppler-0.18


If you install the .deb package this packages will be automatically
installed if needed.

In addition you may want the following packages to get the default
converters (the .deb package has a "Suggests" dependency on then):

   unoconv ghostscript


.. note: Druwez needs at least Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 10 or another
   distro that comes with Python 3.6 or newer
