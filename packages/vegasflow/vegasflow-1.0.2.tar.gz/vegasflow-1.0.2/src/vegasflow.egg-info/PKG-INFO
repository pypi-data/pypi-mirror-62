        # VegasFlow
        
        VegasFlow is a Monte Carlo integration library written in Python and based on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework. It is developed with a focus on speed and efficiency, enabling researchers to perform very expensive calculation as quick and easy as possible.
        
        Some of the key features of VegasFlow are:
        - Integrates efficiently high dimensional functions on single (multi-threading) and multi CPU, single and multi GPU, many GPUs or clusters.
        
        - Compatible with Python, C, C++ or Fortran.
        
        - Implementation of different Monte Carlo algorithms.

        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed with pip:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install vegasflow
        ```
        
        as well as with `conda`, from the `conda-forge` channel:
        ```
        conda install vegasflow -c conda-forge
        ```
        
        If you prefer a manual installation just use:
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        or if you are planning to extend or develop code just use:
        ```
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        There are some examples in the `examples/` folder.
