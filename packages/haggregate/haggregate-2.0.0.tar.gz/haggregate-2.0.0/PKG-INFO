        History
        =======
        
        2.0.0 (2020-02-23)
        ==================
        
        - Only Python>=3.7 is now supported.
        
        1.0.2 (2020-01-22)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed crash if result had only NaN values.
        
        1.0.1 (2020-01-10)
        ==================
        
        - Made installation process more robust. Sometimes it could fail,
          depending on the environment.
        
        1.0.0 (2020-01-05)
        ==================
        
        - Now uses version 5 of hts file (i.e. different time step notation).
        
        0.2.0 (2019-12-05)
        ==================
        
        - Added option target_timestamp_offset.
        
        0.1.4 (2019-07-19)
        ==================
        
        - Greatly reduced memory usage.
        
        0.1.3 (2019-07-03)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed bug where Timezone wasn't being set in the output file.
        
        0.1.2 (2019-06-25)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed erroneous setting of time_step, timestamp_rounding and
          timestamp_offset in the resulting time series.
        - You can now import regularize from haggregate (before you imported it
          from haggregate.regularize).
        
        0.1.1 (2019-06-24)
        ==================
        
        - Initial release
        
          (There is also a 0.1.0 release on PyPI, which was uploaded during
          experimentation, but it doesn't work.)
