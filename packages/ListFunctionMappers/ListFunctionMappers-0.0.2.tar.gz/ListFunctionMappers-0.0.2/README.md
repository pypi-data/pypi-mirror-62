This lilte package is create to allow use to use functional style in a list object.
It is more easier to use when we have for example to deal with a several transforrmation
in our data. 

It the first time I submit a code with an idea. This is the first version. I hope it will
progress in the futur and One will make more functionnal programming style with python
list. 


In this little package, we can find most of function used in a list object but with map
or reduce or flatten,... method.
