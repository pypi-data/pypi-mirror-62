        Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides a field with a datagrid (table), where each row is a sub form.
        
        It is a `z3c.form <https://z3cform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ implementation of the `Products.DataGridField <http://plone.org/products/datagridfield>`_ .
        
        This product was developed for use with Plone and Dexterity.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Add collective.z3cform.datagridfield to your buildout eggs:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.z3cform.datagridfield
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        This piece of code demonstrates a schema which has a table within it.
        The layout of the table is defined by a second schema:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from collective.z3cform.datagridfield import DataGridFieldFactory
            from collective.z3cform.datagridfield import DictRow
            from z3c.form import field
            from z3c.form import form
            from z3c.form.form import extends
            from zope import interface
            from zope import component
            from zope import schema
        
        
            class ITableRowSchema(interface.Interface):
                one = schema.TextLine(title=u"One")
                two = schema.TextLine(title=u"Two")
                three = schema.TextLine(title=u"Three")
        
        
            class IFormSchema(interface.Interface):
                four = schema.TextLine(title=u"Four")
                table = schema.List(title=u"Table",
                    value_type=DictRow(title=u"tablerow", schema=ITableRowSchema))
        
            @component.adapter(IFormSchema)
            class EditForm(form.EditForm):
        
                fields = field.Fields(IFormSchema)
                label=u"Demo Usage of DataGridField"
        
                fields['table'].widgetFactory = DataGridFieldFactory
        
        Configured like so:
        
        .. code-block:: xml
        
            <browser:page
                name="editform--example"
                class=".editform.EditForm"
                for="*"
                permission="zope2.View"
                />
        
        
        Also it can be used from a supermodel XML:
        
        .. code-block:: xml
        
            <field name="table" type="zope.schema.List">
              <description/>
              <title>Table</title>
              <value_type type="collective.z3cform.datagridfield.DictRow">
                <schema>your.package.interfaces.ITableRowSchema</schema>
              </value_type>
              <form:widget type="collective.z3cform.datagridfield.DataGridFieldFactory"/>
            </field>
        
        
        Storage
        -------
        
        The data can be stored as either a list of dicts or a list of objects.
        If the data is a list of dicts, the value_type is DictRow.
        Otherwise, the value_type is 'schema.Object'.
        
        If you are providing an Object content type (as opposed to dicts) you must provide your own conversion class.
        The default conversion class returns a list of dicts,
        not of your object class.
        See the demos.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        
        Row editor handles
        ------------------
        
        The widget can be customised via the updateWidgets method.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def updateWidgets(self):
                super(EditForm, self).updateWidgets()
                self.widgets['table'].allow_insert = False # Enable/Disable the insert button on the right
                self.widgets['table'].allow_delete = False # Enable/Disable the delete button on the right
                self.widgets['table'].auto_append = False  # Enable/Disable the auto-append feature
                self.widgets['table'].allow_reorder = False  # Enable/Disable the re-order rows feature
                self.widgets['table'].main_table_css_class = 'my_custom_class'  # Change the class applied on the main table when the field is displayed
        
        The widget contains an attribute 'columns' which is manipulated to hide column
        titles.
        
        
        Block edit mode
        ---------------
        
        A widget class variation ``BlockDataGridField`` is provided.
        This widget renders subform widgets vertically in blocks instead of horizontally in cells.
        It makes sense when there are many subform fields and they have problem to fit on the screen once.
        
        Example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            class EditForm9(EditForm):
                label = u'Rendering widgets as blocks instead of cells'
        
                grok.name('demo-collective.z3cform.datagrid-block-edit')
        
                def update(self):
                    # Set a custom widget for a field for this form instance only
                    self.fields['address'].widgetFactory = BlockDataGridFieldFactory
                    super(EditForm9, self).update()
        
        
        Manipulating the Sub-form
        -------------------------
        
        The DataGridField makes use of a subform to build each line.
        The main DataGridField contains a DataGridFieldObject for each line in the table.
        The DataGridFieldObject in turn creates the DataGridFieldObjectSubForm to store the fields.
        
        There are two callbacks to your main form:
        
        **datagridInitialise(subform, widget)**
        
        * This is called when the subform fields have been initialised,
          but before the widgets have been created. Field based configuration could occur here.
        
        **datagridUpdateWidgets(subform, widgets, widget)**
        
        * This is called when the subform widgets have been created.
          At this point,  you can configure the widgets, e.g. specify the size of a widget.
        
        Here is an example how one can customize per-field widgets for the data grid field:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from .widget import DGFTreeSelectFieldWidget
            from collective.z3cform.datagridfield import DataGridFieldFactory
            from collective.z3cform.datagridfield import DictRow
            from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import ISiteRoot
            from z3c.form import form
            from zope import interface
            from zope import schema
        
        
            class ITableRowSchema(form.Schema):
        
                form.widget(one=DGFTreeSelectFieldWidget)
                one = schema.TextLine(title=u"Level 1")
        
                form.widget(two=DGFTreeSelectFieldWidget)
                two = schema.TextLine(title=u"Level 2")
        
                # Uses the default widget
                three = schema.TextLine(title=u"Level 3")
        
        
            class IFormSchema(form.Schema):
        
                form.widget(table=DataGridFieldFactory)
                table = schema.List(
                    title=u"Nested selection tree test",
                    value_type=DictRow(
                        title=u"tablerow",
                        schema=ITableRowSchema
                    )
                )
        
        
        Working with plone.app.registry
        -------------------------------
        
        To use the field with plone.app.registry, you'll have to use
        a version of the field that has PersistentField as it's base
        class:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from collective.z3cform.datagridfield.registry import DictRow
        
        
        JavaScript events
        -----------------
        
        ``collective.z3cform.datagridfield`` fires jQuery events,
        so that you can hook them in your own Javascript for DataGridField
        behavior customization.
        
        The following events are currently fired against ``table.datagridwidget-table-view``
        
        * ``beforeaddrow`` [datagridfield, newRow]
        
        * ``afteraddrow`` [datagridfield, newRow]
        
        * ``beforeaddrowauto`` [datagridfield, newRow]
        
        * ``afteraddrowauto`` [datagridfield, newRow]
        
        * ``aftermoverow`` [datagridfield]
        
        * ``afterdatagridfieldinit`` - All DGFs on the page have been initialized
        
        Example usage:
        
        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            var handleDGFInsert = function(event, dgf, row) {
                row = $(row);
                console.log("Got new row:");
                console.log(row);
            };
        
            // Bind all DGF handlers on the page
            $(document).on('beforeaddrow beforeaddrowauto', '.datagridwidget-table-view', handleDGFInsert);

        0.15 (2013-09-24)
        -----------------
        
        - Added possibility to define the CSS class for the main table when the field is displayed.
          This way, you can use common Plone existing classes (like 'listing').
          [gbastien]
        
        - Fixed auto-append bug when there is more than one datagrid field in page auto-appending one field binds
          "change.dgf" to another field also. added "$(dgf).find(.." in datagridfield.js line 138 so it binds to right element only.
          [tareqalam]
        
        - Only abort moveRow if the row is really not found and not if the row idx just happens to be 0.
          [gaudenz]

          [gaudenz]
        
        - Relax requirements for markup, don't assume inputs are direct childs of table cells. This makes useing custom
          templates much easier.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Fix validate function signature for IValidator API. The API requires a "force" argument.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Register the SubformAdapter for IPloneForm layer to avoid that the Adapter from plone.app.z3cform
          takes precedence.
          [gaudenz]
        
        
        0.14 (2013-05-24)
        -----------------

          [saily]
        
        - Add new V1 ``bootstrap.py``.
          [saily]
        
        - Added CSS classes to tbody rows (``row-(1...n)``) and thead columns
          (``cell-(1...m)``) to allow more styling in edit forms.
          [saily]
        
        - Fixed wrong template in display mode when set editing to block edit mode [miohtama]
        
        - Added CSS classes (widget.klass attribute) for DataGridField, to separate it from other MultiWidgets [miohtama]
        
        
        0.13 (2013-04-09)
        -----------------
        
        - Add travis-ci configs [jaroel]
        
        - Convert tests to plone.app.testing [jaroel]
        
        - Fix to expect ``zope.schema.interfaces.ValidationError`` to work better
          with *TooLong* and *TooShort* exceptions. [datakurre]
        
        - Fix IE7 failing on `<label>` for manipulation [miohtama]
        
        - Deal with situations where there is zero rows on DGF and no auto-append row available [miohtama]
        
        - Correctly bind DGF events on DOM content loaded, not when Javascript is parsed [miohtama]
        
        - Don't display movement handles if the row cannot be moved [miohtama]
        
        - Changed move up and down handlers to stay in fixed positions to make cells stay in the same width regardless of moving [miohtama]
        
        - Fixed checkbox saving, was broken by nested DGF support [miohtama]
        
        - Added block edit mode [miohtama]

        0.12 (2012-10-30)
        --------------------
        
        - Updated empty row selection. [jstegle]
        
        - Nested DataGridField support (yo dawg...) [miohtama]
        
        - Support plone.autoform and grok'ed row schemas [miohtama]
        
        - Added ``DataGridField.extra`` parameter, so you can pass out
          application specific data to Javascript [miohtama]
        
        
        0.11 (2012-05-16)
        -----------------
        
        - be able to use with plone.app.registry
          [vangheem]
        
        
        0.10 (2012-02-12)
        -----------------
        
        - Fix bug with moving the last row up.
          [m-martinez]
        
        
        0.9 (2011-10-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Clone events when adding new row - fixes bug where browse button of
          plone.formwidget.contenttree did nothing for new rows
          [anthonygerrard]
        
        - Reindex more indexed attributes of cloned row
          [anthonygerrard]
        
        
        0.8 (2011-09-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid using the "row" CSS class.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Fixes to work with jQuery 1.3.x (use .remove() instead of .detach(), fetch data
          attributes a different way, and avoid live binding the change event).
          [davisagli]
        
        - Don't error out when getting a ``FormatterValidationError``, pass
          it on to z3c.form instead.
          [claytron]
        
        - Give manipulator images a relative src rather than absolute. This
          previously meant the widget didn't work on sites without Plone/Zope at the
          root of the domain.
          [davidjb]
        
        - During auto-insert, add our new row into the document first, before reindexing
          it and changing its elements' IDs. This allows Javascript that depends on
          these IDs (such as plone.formwidget.autocomplete) to pick up the correct
          fields.
          [davidjb]
        
        - Tidying up and reducing complexity of auto-insert functionality
          [davidjb]
        
        - Removing unnecessary auto-insert bind and unbind as this is already covered
          by jQuery's `live()` function against the `auto-append` class. Adding/removing
          this class against rows automatically does this.
          [davidjb]
        
        - Resolved issue with auto-insert functionality not working by removing
          table-specific check in Javascript.
          [davidjb]
        
        
        0.7 (2011-07-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed markup/javascript to prevent duplicate HTML id attributes. Changed
          Javascript to allow for datagrid page templates that don't use tables.
          [dextermilo]
        
        - Improve spacing in CSS.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Revert my fix to ensure that blank rows are added, because it duplicated
          a fix in z3c.form resulting in extra rows.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        0.6 (2011-05-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Search for datagridInitialise and datagridUpdateWidgets on the
          parent form, also when in a fieldset.
          [maurits]
        
        - Register templates on plone.app.z3cform.interfaces.IPloneFormLayer to
          take precedence over that packages list widget templates.
          [elro]
        
        - Make sure that updateWidgets is called to add blank rows even if the
          widget has no value.
          [davisagli]
        
        - When extracting a row value fails due to a validation error, convert
          widget values to field values so the value can be successfully applied
          to the grid widget.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Register a plone.supermodel handler for the DictRow so it can be used
          in supermodel models.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Depend on collective.z3cform.datagridfield_demo as a test extra;
          use the browser view from this package in the tests.
          [maurits]
        
        - _validate still used when import/exporting, fix up code so it works
          [lentinj]
        
        - Add a DictRow serializer for transmogrify.dexterity
          [lentinj]
        
        - Only use width:100% on input cells that are the only element in the cell
          [lentinj]
        
        - Reorder row indices backwards when adding rows. This means that adjacent
          rows don't share the same index temporarily, for example:-
          - Row 1 and 2 contain input:radio based widgets
          - Row 0 added, row renumbering starts
          - Row 1 widgets renamed 2
          - Both sets of input:radio share the same name, one deselected
          - Row 2 widgets renamed 3
          - . . .
          [lentinj]
        
        - Use jQuery to clone rows, and clone the jQuery events on the rows.
          [lentinj]
        
        - Implemented reorder functionality
        
        
        0.5 (2011-02-08)
        ----------------
        
        - Put in the DictRow class (tks Martin Aspeli)
        
        - Moved the demo code out to a separate package collective.z3cform.datagridfield_demo
          (tks Laurence Rowe).
        
        - Removed superfluous lines from setup.py (tks Laurence Rowe).
        
        - Removed unnessary dependency on dexterity (tks Laurence Rowe).
        
        - Removed unnessary dependency on grok (tks Laurence Rowe).
        
        
        0.4 (2011-02-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Renamed the demo pages. The starting point is now @@demo-collective.z3cform.datagrid .
        
        - The widget can now be configured via the updateWidgets method. It
          is no longer necessary to create a custom factory.
        
        - The columns can now be omitted.
        
        - Provide a set of demo views for Object access.
        
        
        0.3 (2011-02-04)
        ----------------
        
        - The auto-append functionality did not bind correctly for popup forms.
          I switched to using jQuery.live() instead of binding at document load time.
        
        - Added a menu to the demo pages
        
        - Added a display only form option.
        
        - Fixed the restructured text of the main README.txt so that it will show
          more friendly in PyPI.
