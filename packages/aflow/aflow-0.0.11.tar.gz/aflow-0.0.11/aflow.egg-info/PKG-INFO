        ``AFLOW`` Python API
        ====================
        
        Python API wrapping the AFLUX API language for AFLOW library. *Note:*

        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install ``aflow`` from the python package index:
        
        ::
        
           pip install aflow
        
        Or alternatively install ``aflow`` from conda using:
        
        ::
        
           conda install -c conda-forge aflow
        
        Open an ipython notebook or terminal and execute the query from the
        paper:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from aflow import *
        
           result = search(batch_size=20
                   ).select(K.agl_thermal_conductivity_300K
                   ).filter(K.Egap > 6).orderby(K.agl_thermal_conductivity_300K, True)
        
           # Now, you can just iterate over the results.
           for entry in result:
               print(entry.Egap)
        
        ``aflow`` supports lazy evaluation. This means that if you didn’t ask
        for a particular property during the initial query, you can just ask for
        it later and the request will happen transparently in the background.
        
        Python 2 Support
        ================
        
        Although the package was originally designed to be compatible with both
        python 2 and python 3, python 2 has reached the end of its life. As
        such, we don’t guarantee anymore that it will work.
