        Automatic Python API reference documentation generator for Sphinx, inspired by
        Doxygen.
        
        AutoAPI is a Sphinx extension that allows to automatically generate API
        reference documentation for Python packages, recursively, without any
        intervention from the developer. It will discover all the package modules and
        their public objects and document them.
