# Change Log

## [0.1.4] = 2019-10-27

    Update travis.yml to install gdal. Solves a build issue.
    
    Add a comment count template view.
    
## [0.1.3] = 2019-10-27

    Add data migration to insure that the 'assoc' value is set in the TreeComments
    
## [0.1.2] = 2019-10-23

    Added a Manager method: ```user_flags_for_model```
    
    This method uses the Postgres only ArrayAgg, if Postgres is available. 
    This also required me to expand my checking so that the module can still work if postgres is
    not used. This will require some more elaborate testing in the future, if I want to test with postgres
    and without. I'll likely test locally with postgres
    
## [0.1.1] - 2019-10-23

    Added a migrations that was missed in the previous version. The migration adds the 
    Blank=True to the 'assoc' ForeignKey for TreeComments
    
    
## [0.1.0] - 2019-10-23

    Denormalized the CommentAssociation model by adding an 'assoc' into each TreeComment
    object. This is set to the association model connected to the root.
    
    Having this value on each comment enables more efficient queries when getting lists of
    comments for a particular level, or for a particular page, user, or list of content types.
    
    Converted the CommentAssociation root = ForeignKey into a OneToOneField so that the
    reverse relationship can be traversed. Now it is possible to use root.commentassociation
    
    Added select_related('commentassociation') to the main queryset so that the association
    is always returned with the root. Generally the root will need this for subsequent 
    queries, so it is best to select it whenever the root is selected.
    
    Added logic to insure that new TreeComment objects have the 'assoc' set upon creation.
    
    Added logic to update the root with the assoc value if not already set, this will insure
    that all root values have this set when queried.
    
    Expanded the tests on the  models.
