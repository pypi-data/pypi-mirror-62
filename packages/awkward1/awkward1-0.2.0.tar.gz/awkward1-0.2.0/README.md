## Motivation for a new Awkward Array

Awkward Array has proven to be a useful way to analyze variable-length and tree-like data in Python, by extending Numpy's idioms from rectilinear arrays to arrays of complex data structures. For over a year, physicists have been using Awkward Array both in and out of [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot#readme); it is already one of the most popular Python packages in particle physics.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/awkward-0-popularity.png" width="60%"></p>

However, its pure-NumPy implementation is hard to extend (finding for-loop-free implementations of operations on nested data is _hard_) and maintain (most bugs are NumPy corner cases). Also, the feedback users have given me through [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array/issues), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array), and [in-person tutorials](https://github.com/jpivarski/2019-07-29-dpf-python#readme) have pointed out some design mistakes. A backward-incompatible release will allow us to fix design mistakes while providing freedom to make deep changes in the implementation.

The Awkward 1.0 project is a major investment, a six-month sprint from late August 2019 to late February 2020. The time spent on a clean, robust Awkward Array is justified by the widespread adoption of Awkward 0.x: its usefulness to the community has been demonstrated.

## Main goals of Awkward 1.0

   * Full access to create and manipulate Awkward Arrays in C++ with no Python dependencies. This is so that C++ libraries can produce and share data with Python front-ends.
   * Easy installation with `pip install` and `conda install` for most users (Mac, Windows, and [most Linux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)).
   * Imperative (for-loop-style) access to Awkward Arrays in [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), a just-in-time compiler for Python. This is so that physicists can write critical loops in straightforward Python without a performance penalty.
   * A single `awkward.Array` class that hides the details of how columnar data is built, with a suite of operations that apply to all internal types.
   * Conformance to NumPy, where Awkward and NumPy overlap.
   * Better control over "behavioral mix-ins," such as `LorentzVector` (i.e. adding methods like `pt()` to arrays of records with `px` and `py` fields). In Awkward 0.x, this was achieved with multiple inheritance, but that was brittle.
   * Support for set operations and database-style joins, which can be put to use in a [declarative analysis language](https://github.com/jpivarski/PartiQL#readme), but requires database-style accounting of an index (like a Pandas index).
   * Better interoperability with Pandas, NumExpr, and Dask, while maintaining support for ROOT, Arrow, and Parquet.
   * Ability to add GPU implementations of array operations in the future.
   * Better error messages and extensive documentation.

## Architecture of Awkward 1.0

To achieve these goals, Awkward 1.0 is separated into four layers:

   1. The user-facing Python layer with a single `awkward.Array` class, whose data is described by a [datashape](https://datashape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) type.
   2. The columnar representation (i.e. nested `ListArray`, `RecordArray`, etc.) is accessible but hidden, and these are all C++ classes presented to Python through [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
   3. Two object models for the columnar representation, one in C++11 (with only header-only dependencies) and the other as [Numba extensions](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/extending/index.html). This is the only layer in which array-allocation occurs.
   4. A suite of operations on arrays, computing new values but not allocating memory. The first implementation of this suite is in C++ with a pure-C interface; the second may be CUDA (or other GPU language). With one exception (`FillableArray`), iterations over arrays only occur at this level, so performance optimizations can focus on this layer.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/awkward-1-0-layers.png" width="60%"></p>

## The Awkward transition

Since Awkward 1.0 is not backward-compatible, existing users of Awkward 0.x will need to update their scripts or only use the new version on new scripts. Awkward 1.0 is already available to early adopters as [awkward1 in pip](https://pypi.org/project/awkward1/) (`pip install awkward1` and `import awkward1` in Python). When [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot#readme) is ready to use the new Awkward Array,

   * it will be released as **uproot 4.0**,
   * **awkward1** will be renamed **awkward**, and
   * the old Awkward 0.x will be renamed **awkward0**.

The original Awkward 0.x will be available in perpetuity as **awkward0**, but only minor bugs will be fixed, and that only for the duration of 2020. This repository will replace [scikit-hep/awkward-array](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array#readme) on GitHub.

## Normal installation

Normally, you would install Awkward [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awkward1/) using pip

```bash
pip install awkward1
```

to get the latest release of Awkward 1.0 as a precompiled wheel. If a wheel does not exist for your combination of operating system and Python version, the above command attempts to compile from source, downloading any dependencies it needs to do that.

## Manually installing from source

If you need to force an installation from source, get it from GitHub via

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0.git
```

(note the recursive git-clone; it is required to get C++ dependencies) and compile+install with dependencies via

```bash
pip install .
```

or

```bash
pip install .[test,dev]
```

to perform tests (`[test]`) on all optional dependencies (`[dev]`).

## Development workflow

If you are developing Awkward Array, manually installing from source will work, but it doesn't cache previously compiled code for rapid recompilation. Instead, get it from GitHub via

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0.git
```

(note the recursive git-clone; it is required to get C++ dependencies) and compile+install with dependencies via

```bash
python localbuild.py --pytest tests
```

The `--pytest tests` optionally runs selected tests. See 

```bash
python localbuild.py --help
```

for more information. The build is based on CMake; see [localbuild.py](./localbuild.py) if you need to run CMake directly.

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are hosted by Azure Pipelines:

## Building projects that depend on Awkward

Python projects can simply use `awkward1` as a Python library.

C++ projects can either link against the shared libraries `libawkward-cpu-kernels.so` and `libawkward.so` or the static libraries, whose names end in `-static`. All four libraries, as well as their C++ header files, are shipped with the Python library. Even if you installed Awkward Array with pip, you'll have everything you need to build an Awkward C++ program.

If you also want to bind your C++ to Python and share Awkward Arrays between modules in Python, see the [dependent-project](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/tree/master/dependent-project) example. This is a small CMake project bound to Python with pybind11 that can produce and consume Awkward Arrays in Python. Such projects depend on a specific version of Awkward Array, but we intend to stabilize the ABI for more flexibility.

## Roadmap

**The six-month ~~sprint~~ marathon:**

   * [X] **September 2019:** Set up CI/CD; define jagged array types in C++; pervasive infrastructure like database-style indexing.
   * [X] **October 2019:** NumPy-compliant slicing; the Numba implementation. Feature parity will be maintained in Numba continuously.
   * [X] **November 2019:** Fillable arrays to create columnar data; high-level type objects; all list and record types.
   * [X] **December 2019:** The `awkward.Array` user interface; behavioral mix-ins, including the string type.
   * [X] **January 2020:** [NEP 13](https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html) and [NEP 18](https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html); the rest of the array nodes: option and union types, indirection.
   * [X] **February 2020:** The array operations: flattening, padding, concatenating, combinatorics, etc. and array types needed for [Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/milestone/1) and [Arrow/Parquet](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/milestone/3) (chunked, virtual, masked, etc.).

**Updating dependent libraries:**

   * [ ] **March 2020:** Update [vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector) (from [hepvector](https://github.com/henryiii/hepvector#readme) and [uproot-methods](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot-methods#readme)). This work will be done with [Henry Schreiner](https://github.com/henryiii).
   * [ ] **April 2020:** Update [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot#readme) to 4.0 using Awkward 1.0.

Most users will see Awkward 1.0 for the first time when uproot 4.0 is released.

   * [X] Extend `__getitem__` to take jagged arrays of integers and booleans (same behavior as old; issue [#67](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/67)).
   * [ ] Full suite of array types:
      * [X] `EmptyArray`: 1-dimensional array with length 0 and unknown type (result of `UnknownFillable`, compatible with all types of arrays).
      * [X] `RawArray`: flat, 1-dimensional array type for pure C++ (header-only).
      * [X] `NumpyArray`: rectilinear, N-dimensional array type without Python/pybind11 dependencies, but intended for Numpy.
      * [X] `ListArray`: the new `JaggedArray`, based on `starts` and `stops` (i.e. fully general).
      * [X] `ListOffsetArray`: the `JaggedArray` case with no unreachable data between reachable data (gaps).
      * [X] `RegularArray`: for building rectilinear, N-dimensional arrays of arbitrary contents, e.g. putting jagged dimensions inside fixed dimensions.
      * [X] `RecordArray`: the new `Table` _without_ lazy-slicing.
      * [X] `IndexedArray` and `IndexedOptionArray`: the old `IndexedArray` and `IndexedMaskedArray`; the latter has option type.
      * [X] `UnionArray` (issue [#54](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/54)): same as the old version.
      * [ ] `BitMaskedArray` (issue [#58](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/58)): for nullable data with a bit mask (for Arrow).
      * [ ] `UnmaskedArray` (issue [#59](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/59)): for optional type without actually having a mask.
      * [ ] `ChunkedArray` (issue [#56](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/56)): same as the old version, except that the type is a union if chunks conflict, not an error, and knowledge of all chunk sizes is always required. Also, this will only be available on the top of a hierarchy (without nesting).
      * [ ] `VirtualArray` (issue [#57](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/57)): same as old `VirtualArray`.
   * [X] Describe high-level types using [datashape](https://datashape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and possibly also an in-house schema. (Emit datashape _strings_ from C++.)
   * [ ] Translation to and from Apache Arrow and Parquet in C++ (issue [#68](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/68)).
   * [X] Layer 1 interface `Array`:
      * [X] Pass through to the layout classes in Python and Numba.
      * [X] Pass through Numpy ufuncs using [NEP 13](https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html) (as before; issue [#60](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/60)).
      * [X] Pass through other Numpy functions using [NEP 18](https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html) (this would be new; issue [#61](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/61)).
      * [X] `RecordArray` fields (not called "columns" anymore) through Layer 1 `__getattr__` (issue [#62](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/62)).
      * [X] Special Layer 1 `Record` type for `RecordArray` elements, supporting some methods and a visual representation based on `Identity` if available, all fields if `recordtype == "tuple"`, or the first field otherwise.
      * [X] Mechanism for adding user-defined `Methods` like `LorentzVector`, as before, but only on Layer 1.
         * [X] High-level classes for characters and strings.
      * [X] Inerhit from Pandas so that all Layer 1 arrays can be DataFrame columns (issue [#63](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/63)).
   * [ ] Full suite of operations:
      * [X] `awkward.tolist`: same as before.
      * [X] `awkward.fromiter`: same as before.
      * [X] `awkward.typeof`: reports the high-level type (accepting some non-awkward objects).
      * [X] `awkward.tonumpy` (issue [#65](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/65)): to force conversion to Numpy, if possible. Neither Layer 1 nor Layer 2 will have an `__array__` method; in the Numpy sense, they are not "array-like" or "array-compatible."
      * [ ] `awkward.flatpandas` (issue [#80](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/80)): flattening jaggedness into `MultiIndex` rows and nested records into `MultiIndex` columns. This is distinct from the arrays' inheritance from Pandas, distinct from the natural ability to use any one of them as DataFrame columns.
      * [ ] `awkward.flatten`: same as old with an `axis` parameter (issue [#51](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/51)).
      * [X] Reducers, such as `awkward.sum`, `awkward.max`, etc., supporting an `axis` method (issue [#69](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/69)).
      * [X] The non-reducers: `awkward.moment`, `awkward.mean`, `awkward.var`, `awkward.std` (addendum to issue [#69](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/69)).
      * [ ] `awkward.argmin`, `awkward.argmax` (issue [#70](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/70)): return values and `None` instead of singleton and empty lists.
      * [ ] `awkward.argsort`, and `awkward.sort` (issue [#74](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/74)): same as old.
      * [X] `awkward.where` (issue [#75](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/75)): like `numpy.where`; old doesn't have this yet, but we'll need it.
      * [X] `awkward.concatenate` (issue [#76](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/76)): same as old, but supporting `axis` at any depth.
      * [ ] `awkward.zip` (issue [#77](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/77)): makes jagged tables; this is a naive version of `awkward.join` below.
      * [ ] `awkward.pad` (issue [#73](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/73)): same as old, but without the `clip` option (use slicing instead).
      * [ ] `awkward.fillna` (issue [#72](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/72)): same as old.
      * [ ] `awkward.cross` (and `awkward.argcross`, issue [#78](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/78)): to make combinations by cross-joining multiple arrays; option to use `Identity` index.
      * [ ] `awkward.choose` (and `awkward.argchoose`, issue [#79](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/79)): to make combinations by choosing a fixed number from a single array; option to use `Identity` index and an option to include same-object combinations.

### Soon after the six-month sprint

   * [ ] Update [hepvector](https://github.com/henryiii/hepvector#readme) to be Derived classes, replacing the `TLorentzVectorArray` in uproot-methods.
   * [ ] Update uproot (on a branch) to use Awkward 1.0.
   * [ ] Start the `awkward → awkward0`, `awkward1 → awkward` transition.

### Thereafter

   * [ ] GPU implementations of the cpu-kernels in Layer 4, with the Layer 3 C++ passing a "device" variable at every level of the layout to indicate whether the data pointers refer to main memory or a particular GPU.
   * [ ] CPU-acceleration of the cpu-kernels using vectorization and other tricks.
   * [X] Explicit interface with [NumExpr](https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
   * [ ] Explicit interface with [Dask](https://dask.org).
   * [ ] Demonstrate Awkward 1.0 as a C++ wrapping library with [FastJet](http://fastjet.fr/).
   * [ ] Deferred array types:
      * [ ] `ByteMaskedArray`: for nullable data with a byte mask (for NumPy).
      * [ ] `RedirectArray`: an explicit weak-reference to another part of the structure (no hard-linked cycles). Often used with an `IndexedArray`.
      * [ ] `SparseUnionArray`: the additional `UnionArray` case found in Apache Arrow.
      * [ ] `SparseArray`: same as the old version, but now we need a good lookup mechanism.
      * [ ] `RegularChunkedArray`: like a `ChunkedArray`, but all chunks are known to have the same size.
      * [ ] `AmorphousChunkedArray`: a `ChunkedArray` without known chunk lengths (maybe not ever).
      * [ ] `UnionArray` in Numba. Have to [somehow deal with heterogeneity](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/pull/118#issuecomment-590542012).
      * [ ] Strings in Numba (issue [#124](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues/124)).
   * [ ] Deferred operations:
      * [ ] `awkward.join`: performs an inner join of multiple arrays; requires `Identity`. Because the `Identity` is a surrogate index, this is effectively a per-event intersection, zipping all fields.
      * [ ] `awkward.union`: performs an outer join of multiple arrays; requires `Identity`. Because the `Identity` is a surrogate index, this is effectively a per-event union, zipping fields where possible.
   * [ ] Persistence to any medium that stores named binary blobs, as before, but accessible via C++ (especially for writing). The persistence format might differ slightly from the existing one (break backward compatibility, if needed).
   * [ ] Describe mid-level "persistence types" with no lengths, somewhat minimal JSON, optional dtypes/compression.
   * [ ] Describe low-level layouts independently of filled arrays (JSON or something)?
   * [ ] Universal `array.get[...]` as a softer form of `array[...]` that inserts `None` for non-existent indexes, rather than raising errors.
