Description: 
        With dantro, hierarchically structured heterogeneous data can be loaded into a
        uniform data structure, a so-called data tree. Furthermore, dantro provides
        capabilities to generically work on and create plots from that data. The whole
        package aims at implementing an abstract and homogeneous interface that allows
        specializing the provided classes to the needs to the data that is to be worked
        with. At the same time, it already provides useful functionality, which makes
        specialization easier.
