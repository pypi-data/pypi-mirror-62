Welcome to resonance's documentation!
=====================================

Resonance is a companion software library to an interactive textbook written for
an upper level undergraduate introduction to mechanical vibrations course.

The library is specifically designed for learning engineering principles
through computational thinking and computational experimentation and thus we
have guidelines on its design to facilitate this. Those guidelines are roughly:

- Don't teach programming for the sake of teaching programming. Show students
  how to solve problems and introduce programming along the way to solve those
  problems.
- Hide the fine details of programming and only use simple constructs, so that
  learning vibrations is highlighted instead of programming.
- Hide the simulation details (linear/nonlinear ODE solutions), but allow them
  to be exposed if needed.
- The software design is centered around the "System" object. Systems represent
  real things: a car, a bridge, a bicycle, an airplane wing.
- Students can use and construct systems.
- Students only create functions, no need to understand classes and their
  construction.
- Easy visualizations (time history plots and animations of systems)
- Extra informative and lots of error messages (try to predict student
  mistakes)
