Description: # About
        
        A module for easily timing sections of code.
        
        # Installation
        
        ```
        pip install easytimer
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        - tick() starts a new section timer and ends the previous section timer
        - tock() prints out the runtime for each section so far
        - Calling tick() multiple times with the same name adds to a running total for that name
        
        ## Examples
        
        ```python
        from easytimer import tick, tock
        import time
        
        # Example with unnamed sections
        tick()
        time.sleep(0.1)
        tick()
        time.sleep(0.2)
        tick()
        time.sleep(0.1)
        
        ```
        
        ```
        --- Timer Results ---
        tick 1 - 0.10s
        tick 2 - 0.20s
        tick 3 - 0.10s
        ---------------------
        ```
        
        ```python
        # Example with named sections
        tick('Setup')
        time.sleep(0.1)
        
        tick('Multi')
        time.sleep(0.2)
        
        tick('Intermediate')
        time.sleep(0.3)
        
        tick('Multi')
        time.sleep(0.4)
        
        tock()
        ```
        
        ```
        --- Timer Results ---
        Setup        - 0.10s
        Multi        - 0.60s
        Intermediate - 0.30s
        ---------------------
        ```
        
        ```python
        # Example with loop
        tick("Part A")
        time.sleep(0.1)
        for i in range(10):
            tick('Part B1')
            time.sleep(0.02)
            tick('Part B2')
            time.sleep(0.03)
        tick("Part C")
        time.sleep(0.4)
        
        tock()
        ```
        
        ```
        --- Timer Results ---
        Part A  - 0.10s
        Part B1 - 0.20s
        Part B2 - 0.30s
        Part C  - 0.40s
        ---------------------
        ```
