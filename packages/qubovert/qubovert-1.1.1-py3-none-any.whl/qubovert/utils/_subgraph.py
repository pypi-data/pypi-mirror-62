"""_subgraph.py.

This file contains the function to create subgraphs of QUBOs, PUBOs, QUSOs,
PUSOs, etc.

def subgraph(G, nodes, connections=None):
    """subgraph.

    Create the subgraph of ``G`` that only includes vertices in ``nodes``, and
    external nodes are given the values in ``connections``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : dict or any subclass of dict.
        ``G`` must contain tuple keys.
    nodes : set.
        Nodes of ``G`` to include in the subgraph.
    connections : dict (optional, defaults to {}).
        For each node in ``G`` that is not in ``nodes``, we assign a value
        given by ``connections.get(node, 0)``.

    Return
    ------
    D : same as type(G).
        The subgraph of ``G`` with nodes in ``nodes`` and the values of the
        nodes not included given by ``connections``.

    Notes
    -----
    Any offset value included in ``G`` (ie {(): 1}) will be ignored, however
    there may be an offset in the output ``D``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = {(0, 1): -4, (0, 2): -1, (0,): 3, (1,): 2, (): 2}
    >>> D = subgraph(G, {0, 2}, {1: 5})
    >>> D
    {(0,): -17, (0, 2): -1, (): 10}

    >>> G = {(0, 1): -4, (0, 2): -1, (0,): 3, (1,): 2, (): 2}
    >>> D = subgraph(G, {0, 2})
    >>> D
    {(0, 2): -1, (0,): 3}

    >>> G = {(0, 1): -4, (0, 2): -1, (0,): 3, (1,): 2, (): 2}
    >>> D = subgraph(G, {0, 1}, {2: -10})
    >>> D
    {(0, 1): -4, (0,): 13, (1,): 2}

    >>> G = {(0, 1): -4, (0, 2): -1, (0,): 3, (1,): 2, (): 2}
    >>> D = subgraph(G, {0, 1})
    >>> D
    {(0, 1): -4, (0,): 3, (1,): 2}
