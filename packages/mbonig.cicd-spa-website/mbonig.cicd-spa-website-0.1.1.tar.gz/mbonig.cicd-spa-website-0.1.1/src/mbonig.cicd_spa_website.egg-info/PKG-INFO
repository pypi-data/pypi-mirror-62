Description: # SPA + CICD Website Construct
        
        This CDK construct is used to create a static website with a CodePipeline to deploy
        from source code on pushes to `master`. The goal of this construct is to be able to
        point it at a git repository, give it a url,
        and you've got a continuously deployed static website.
        
        # This is a pre-release!
        
        This is a quick first-draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accomodate a large
        number of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this construct, please
        open an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).
        
        ## What Gets Created
        
        At the base level, the following will be built:
        
        * An S3 bucket for build artifacts
        * An S3 bucket for the website content
        * CICD Pipeline - CodePipeline sourced from Github, built using CodeBuild and deployed to an S3 bucket.
        
        If a certificate is supplied or requested:
        
        * An ACM certificate will be provisioned via DNS if requested
        * A CloudFront Distribution pointing to the S3 bucket.
        
        ## Example
        
        This will create the website, the deployment pipeline, and add a generated certificate (and CloudFront) for HTTPS support.
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        CicdSpaWebsite(stack, "public-site",
            url="www.matthewbonig.com",
            github_source={
                "owner": "mbonig",
                "repo": "public_site",
                "oauth_token": SecretValue.secrets_manager("github-oauth-token")
            },
            hosted_zone={
                "hosted_zone_id": "ABCDEFGHIJKLM",
                "zone_name": "matthewbonig.com"
            },
            certificate=True
        )
        ```
        
        ## Input Properties
        
        |property|description|example
        |---|---|---
        |url|The url you'd like your website to be available at. Must be full url and must be controlled by the given HostedZone| www.matthewbonig.com
        |githubSource.owner|The Github repository's owner | mbonig
        |githubSource.repo|The GH repo name | public_site
        |githubSource.branch|An optional branch name. Defaults to 'master'| qa
        |githubSource.oauthToken|An ISecret pointing to an oauthToken. | SecretValue.secretsManager('github-oauth-token')
        |hostedZone|(Optional) - If provided, used to create DNS Records.
        |hostedZone.hostedZoneId|The hostedZone ID for the 'url's domain | ABCDEFGHI
        |hostedZone.zoneName|The hostedZone's name | matthewbonig.com
        |certificate|(Optional) - If provided, creates a CloudFront Distribution with the given certificate. If 'true' is provided, then a certificate will be generated.| true
        |buildSpec|(Optional) - If provided, will override the default BuildSpec in the CodeBuild project. Accepts either a string value (the filename in the source code) or an object. The object is passed to the [BuildSpec.fromObject()](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-codebuild.BuildSpec.html#static-from-wbr-objectvalue). If not provided, see [BuildSpec](#buildspec).|build-prod.yaml
        
        ## Design Notes
        
        ### Certificates
        
        If a certificate is required to provide HTTPS support then a simple S3 Bucket with website hosting will not work. This construct chooses to put a CloudFront Distribution in front of it when a certificate is required.
        
        If that certificate already exists, it can be supplied as an ICertificate. If not, then it will be created using a [DNSValidatedCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-certificatemanager.DnsValidatedCertificate.html).
        
        If no certificate is supplied or requested, then the site will be hosted using a public S3 Bucket with Website Hosting enabled. No CloudFront Distribution will be created in that case.
        
        ### Github Sources
        
        Github source information is provided through props for the construct.
        
        If you'd like to see support for another type of Source action, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).
        
        ### BuildSpec
        
        The default buildspec is defined at [DEFAULT_BUILD_SPEC](./lib/cicd_spa_website.ts). It uses a Node v12 runtime, runs an `npm install` and then an `npm run build` and assumes the static deliverables are in the `dist` directory.
        
        You may override the BuildSpec with either your own object or by passing a string which will be interpreted as a filename within the source to use.
