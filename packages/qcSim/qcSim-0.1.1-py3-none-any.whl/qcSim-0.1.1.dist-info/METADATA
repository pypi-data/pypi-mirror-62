qcSim is a Python package for the simulation of quantum computers based on the
quantum circuit model.
The goal of this simulator is to provide a simple and understandable syntax that allows 
even people who have only recently started working with quantum computing to implement 
simple quantum algorithms. This rather practical component should make it easier for 
beginners to understand the complex topic of quantum computing. 
The simulator was primarily programmed to implement quantum machine learning and quantum 
optimization subroutines. Some examples can be found in the folder "example subroutines". 
The focus was to clearly show the lower time complexity of quantum algorithms compared 
to their classical counterparts.
