organism.description:	Soybean (Glycine max) is the predominant oil-seed legume worldwide. Although the center of diversity of the genus is in Australia, the species G. max is Asian, and was likely domesticated in East Asia, ~6000-9000 years ago (Sedivy et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14418). It has both many culinary and industrial uses. Some of the culinary uses include: for direct consumption of the green seed (i.e. edamame) and leaves (cooked, much like spinach); for and tofu, soymilk, textured vegetable protein, soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and vegetable oil. Industrial uses include: oils, soap, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Soybean is also used as a high-protein forage, and can be prepared for fish- and animal-feed.
