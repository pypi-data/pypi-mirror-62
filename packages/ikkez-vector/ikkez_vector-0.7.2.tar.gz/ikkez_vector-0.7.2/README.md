# Vector - Python SDK

This is a fork of the original Anki Vector Python SDK. 
Since Anki is down and no longer supporting the SDK and the new owner [DDL](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/) is more likely working on firmware updates at the moment,
I just started this fork as an unofficial version to keep things running for now.
