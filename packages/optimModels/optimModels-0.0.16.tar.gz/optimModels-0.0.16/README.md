optimModels
============

The Python framework under development will allow the strain design of single and microbial community cultures.
The main focus is to provide support for different modeling approaches.


* Simulation: allows to simulate different kinetic metabolic models considering different phenotypes.
For the kinetic models simulation, we use the Odespy framework, which offers a unified interface to a large collection of software for solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

* Optimization: perform the optimization using evolutionary computation. The inspyred framework is used for creating biologically-inspired computational intelligence algorithms in Python, including evolutionary computation.
