Description: =======================================
        Efficient realtime IIR filter in Python
        =======================================
        
        This is an IIR filter class which performs sample by sample realtime
        processing of data. It's very efficient because it's not using any 
        indexing operations internally. The class instance acts as the memory
        of the filter so that it remembers its past.
        
        
        Import
        ======
        
        Use the standard python command to import it::
        
          import iir-filter
        
        
        Calculate the coefficients
        ==========================
        
        Use your favourite scipy IIR design command and export the coefficients as an SOS::
        
            sos = signal.butter(order, [cutoff(s)], '[filter type]', output='sos')
        
        
        
        Create an instance
        ==================
        
        The constructor takes the sos chain as an argument::
        
            f = iir_filter.IIR_filter(sos)
        
        
        
        Perform filtering sample by sample
        ==================================
        
        Filtering is sample by sample by processing the samples
        as they arrive, for example from an ADC::
        
           sample = f.filter(sample)
