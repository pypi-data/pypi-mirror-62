Description: robotpy-build
        =============
        
        This is a build tool designed to meet the needs of RobotPy's various wrapper
        libraries build needs, chiefly around:
        
        * Managing upstream binary dependencies
        * Autogenerating pybind11 wrappers around those dependencies
        * Building wheels from those generated wrappers
        
        Requires Python 3.6+
        
        Workflow
        --------
        
        There are two types of generated artifacts from RobotPy wrapper library
        projects:
        
        * sdist - This should contain enough information to build a wheel
          * This is NOT intended to be usable offline, because upstream artifacts
            can get to be fairly large
        * wheel - Platform specific build installable via pip
          * Should contain headers and libraries necessary for other projects
            to build from it
        
        Eventual goal is to support cross-compilation somehow so we can build
        various types of artifacts via CI
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        TODO: This tool is still very much under development
        
        See [docs/wrapping.md](docs/wrapping.md) for details on writing your
        own wrapped project.
