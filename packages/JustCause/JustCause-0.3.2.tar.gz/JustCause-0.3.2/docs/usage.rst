Quick Overview
==============

To get a quick overview of what JustCause has to offer, let's take a look at the package structure::

    ├── contrib        <- third party methods not meant to be accessed directly
    ├── data
    │   ├── generators <- data generators for full synthetic data sets
    │   ├── sets       <- empirical data sets like IHDP, Twins, etc.
    │   ├── frames     <- provides the CausalFrame
    │   ├── transport  <- functionality to download data sets
    │   └── utils      <- generic helper functions for data sets
    ├── learners
    │   ├── ate        <- average treatment effect estimators
    │   ├── meta       <- meta learners working with the help of classical estimators
    │   ├── nn         <- neural network-based learners
    │   ├── tree       <- tree-based learners
    │   ├── propensity <- functionality estimate propensity scores
    │   └── utils      <- generic helper functions for learners
    ├── evaluation     <- helper functions for evaluation
    ├── metrics        <- various metrics to compare a result to the ground truth
    └── utils          <- most generic helper functions not related to data and learners

Most commonly you will deal with :mod:`.data.generators` and :mod:`.data.sets` to generate or fetch a
data set and apply some learners within :mod:`.learners`. To evaluate your results you can use
:mod:`.metrics` and :mod:`.evaluation`. All methods within :mod:`.contrib` are not meant to be accessed directly and
are wrapped within :mod:`.learners`.


The Reason for DGPs
===================
Due to the so called `Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference`_, there is no ground truth for any real treatment effect dataset.
In order to be able to evaluate methods, we thus need to resort to semi- or fully-synthetic data. The process of generating such a
dataset is called a data generating process (DGP). We distinguish between i) an Empirical Monte Carlo Study `[1]`_ which uses
real covariates - the features of real instances (e.g. patients, ...) - and generates a synthetic potential outcome on top of it and
ii) a fully synthetic approach, where covariates are sampled from some distribution.

Briefly, a reference data set following our convention contains these columns with special meaning:

 - ``t``: binary treatment indicator
 - ``y``: observed outcome
 - ``y_cf``: counterfactual outcome
 - ``y_0``: untreated potential outcome with possible noise
 - ``y_1``: treated potential outcome with possible noise
 - ``mu_0``: true untreated potential outcome without noise
 - ``mu_1``: true treated potential outcome without noise
 - ``ite``: true individual treatment effect

For those columns the following relationships hold:

 - ``y = t*y_1 + (1-t)*y_0``
 - ``y_cf = (1-t)*y_1 + t*y_0`` (*counterfactual* of ``y``)
 - ``y = y_0 if t == 0 else y_1``
 - ``y_0 = mu_0 + e`` and ``y_1 = mu_1 + e`` where e (read epsilon) is some random noise or 0
 - ``ite = mu_1 - mu_0``

Besides these columns, there are covariates (also called features) and optionally other columns for managing meta information
like datetime or an id of sample. Within the provided data sets covariates are called ``x_0``, ``x_1``, etc. by default.
However, named covariates from the IBM or Twins studies are kept in their format (e.g. ``dob_mm`` for date-of-birth month) for clarity.
Accordingly you can also use any name if you use your own data set as explained below. The matrix of all covariates is ``X := [x_0, x_1, ..., x_n]``
and its usage is explained below.
Besides covariates, the provided data sets have a column ``sample_id`` to easily identify one sample in different replications.

Replications
------------
Since most DGPs are based on some form of random sampling, usually researchers use multiple so called replications of the same data
to avoid a large influence of the randomness underlying the distributions. A replication is generated by
sampling from the probability distributions that define the data.
In the case of IHDP 1000 replications of the same data are used for
a full evaluation, thus ensuring robust evaluation results.

The concept of replications is build into JustCause by design to encourage robust comparisons.


.. _handling-data:

Handling Data
=============

JustCause uses a generalization of a Pandas :class:`~pandas.DataFrame` for managing your data named :class:`~justcause.CausalFrame`.
A CausalFrame encompasses all the functionality of a Pandas DataFrame but additionally keeps track which columns, besides
the ones with special meanings like explained above, are covariates or others. This allows to easily access them in a programmatic way.

All data sets provided by JustCause are provided as lists of CausalFrames, i.e. for each replication one CausalFrame.
Thus, we get a single CausalFrame ``cf`` from one of the provided data sets by::

    >>> from justcause.data.sets import load_ihdp

    >>> cf = load_ihdp(select_rep=0)[0]  # select replication 0
    >>> type(cf)
    justcause.data.frames.CausalFrame

As usual, ``cf.columns`` would list the names of all columns. To find out which of these columns are *covariates* or
*others*, we can use the attribute accessor ``names``::

    >>> cf.names.covariates
    ['x_0', 'x_1', 'x_2', ..., 'x_22', 'x_23', 'x_24']
    >>> cf.names.others
    ['sample_id']

This allows us to easily apply transformations for instance only to covariates. In general, this leads to more robust code
since the API of a CausalFrame enforces the differentiation between covariates, columns with special meaning, e.g.
outcome ``y``, treatment ``t`` and other columns such as metadata like a datetime or an id of an observation, e.g. ``sample_id``.

If we want to construct a CausalFrame, we do that just in the same way as with a DataFrame but have to specify covariate columns::

    >>> import justcause as jc
    >>> from numpy.random import rand, randint
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd

    >>> N = 10
    >>> mu_0 = np.zeros(N)
    >>> mu_1 = np.zeros(N)
    >>> ite = mu_1 - mu_0
    >>> y_0 = mu_0 + 0.1*rand(N)
    >>> y_1 = mu_1 + 0.1*rand(N)
    >>> t = randint(2, size=N)
    >>> y = np.where(t, y_1, y_0)
    >>> y_cf = np.where(t, y_0, y_1)

    >>> dates = pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=N)
    >>> cf = jc.CausalFrame({'c1': rand(N),
    >>>                      'c2': rand(N),
    >>>                      'date': dates,
    >>>                      't': t,
    >>>                      'y': y,
    >>>                      'y_cf': y_cf,
    >>>                      'y_0': y_0,
    >>>                      'y_1': y_1,
    >>>                      'mu_0': mu_0,
    >>>                      'mu_1': mu_1,
    >>>                      'ite': ite
    >>>                      },
    >>>                      covariates=['c1', 'c2'])

All columns that are neither covariates nor columns with special meaning like ``t`` and ``y`` are treated as *others*::

    >>> cf.names.others
    ['date']

Working with Learners
=====================

Within the PyData stack, `Numpy`_ surely is the lowest common denominator and is thus used by a lot of libraries. Since
JustCause mainly wraps third-party libraries for causal methods under a common API, the decision was taken to only allow
passing Numpy arrays to the learners, i.e. causal methods, within JustCause. This allows for more flexibility and keeps
the abstraction layer to the original method much smaller.

The ``fit`` method of a learner takes at least the parameters ``X`` for the covariate matrix,  ``t`` for the treatment
and ``y`` for the outcome, i.e. target, vector as Numpy arrays. In order to bridge the gap between rich CausalFrames and
plain arrays, a :class:`~justcause.CausalFrame` provides the attribute accessor ``np`` (for *numpy*). Using it, we can easily pass
the covariates ``X``, treatment ``t`` and outcome ``y`` to a learner::

    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

    >>> reg = RandomForestRegressor()
    >>> learner = jc.learners.SLearner(reg)
    >>> learner.fit(cf.np.X, cf.np.t, cf.np.y)



Evaluating Methods
==================

The central element of JustCause is evaluation. We want to score learners on various datasets using common metrics.
This can either be done manually, or using predefined standard routines (:func:`~justcause.evaluation.evaluate_ite`). JustCause
allows you to do both.

Quickstart
----------
The simplest and fastest evaluation is using standard datasets and the methods provided by JustCause::

    from justcause.learners import SLearner, TLearner, XLearner, RLearner
    from justcause.metrics import pehe_score, mean_absolute
    from justcause.data.sets import load_ihdp

    replications = load_ihdp(select_rep=np.arange(100))
    metrics = [pehe_score, mean_absolute]
    train_size = 0.8
    random_state = 42
    methods = [basic_slearner, weighted_slearner]

    # All in standard configuration
    methods = [SLearner(), weighted_slearner, TLearner(), XLearner(), RLearner()]
    result = evaluate_ite(replications,
                          methods,
                          metrics,
                          train_size=train_size,
                          random_state=random_state)



To better understand what's happening inside and how to customize, let us take a look at an evaluation loop in more detail.

Evaluating Learners
-------------------
Let's implement a simple evaluation of two learners - a weighted SLearner vs. a standard SLearner. The standard SLearner is
already provided in :class:`~justcause.learners.meta.slearner.SLearner`, while the weighted SLearner requires a slight adaption.
We define a callable, which takes train and test data, fits a weighted model and predicts ITE for both train and test samples::

    from justcause.learners import SLearner
    from justcause.learners.propensity import estimate_propensities
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    def weighted_slearner(train, test):
        """
        Custom method that takes 'train' and 'test' CausalFrames (see causal_frames.ipynb)
        and returns ITE predictions for both after training on 'train'.

        Implement your own method in a similar fashion to evaluate them within the framework!
        """
        train_X, train_t, train_y = train.np.X, train.np.t, train.np.y
        test_X, test_t, test_y = test.np.X, test.np.t, test.np.y


        # Get calibrated propensity estimates
        p = estimate_propensities(train_X, train_t)

        # Make sure the supplied learner is able to use `sample_weights` in the fit() method
        slearner = SLearner(LinearRegression())

        # Weight with inverse probability of treatment (inverse propensity)
        slearner.fit(train_X, train_t, train_y, weights=1/p)
        return (
            slearner.predict_ite(train_X, train_t, train_y),
            slearner.predict_ite(test_X, test_t, test_y)
        )


    def basic_slearner(train, test):
        """Basic SLearner callable"""
        train_X, train_t, train_y = train.np.X, train.np.t, train.np.y
        test_X, test_t, test_y = test.np.X, test.np.t, test.np.y

        slearner = SLearner(LinearRegression())
        slearner.fit(train_X, train_t, train_y)
        return (
            slearner.predict_ite(train_X, train_t, train_y),
            slearner.predict_ite(test_X, test_t, test_y)
        )

.. note::
    Another way to add new learners is to implement them as a class similiar to the implementations in :mod:`~justcause.learners`
    (for example :class:`~justcause.learners.meta.slearner.SLearner`) providing at least the methods ``fit(x, t, y)`` and ``predict_ite(x, t, y)``

Custom Evaluation Loop
----------------------
Given the two functions defined above, we can go ahead and write our own simple evaluation loop::

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from justcause.data import Col
    from justcause.data.sets import load_ihdp
    from justcause.metrics import pehe_score, mean_absolute
    from justcause.evaluation import calc_scores, summarize_scores

    replications = load_ihdp(select_rep=np.arange(100))
    metrics = [pehe_score, mean_absolute]
    train_size = 0.8
    random_state = 42
    methods = [basic_slearner, weighted_slearner]

    results = list()

    for method in methods:

        test_scores = list()
        train_scores = list()

        for rep in replications:

            train, test = train_test_split(
                rep, train_size=train_size, random_state=random_state
            )

            # REPLACE this with the function you implemented and want to evaluate
            train_ite, test_ite = method(train, test)

            # Calculate the scores and append them to a dataframe
            test_scores.append(calc_scores(test[Col.ite], test_ite, metrics))
            train_scores.append(calc_scores(train[Col.ite], train_ite, metrics))

        # Summarize the scores and save them in a dataframe
        train_result, test_result = summarize_scores(train_scores), summarize_scores(test_scores)
        train_result.update({'method': method.__name__, 'train': True})
        test_result.update({'method': method.__name__, 'train': False})

        results.append(train_result)
        results.append(test_result)

Finally, we can compare the results:

+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+
| method            | train | pehe_score-mean    | ... | mean_absolute-std  |
+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+
| basic_slearner    | True  | 5.633659795888     | ... | 1.4932757697867    |
+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+
| basic_slearner    | False | 5.625971000721     | ... | 2.4746034286861    |
+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+
| weighted_slearner | True  | 5.592355721307     | ... | 0.5243953093767    |
+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+
| weighted_slearner | False | 5.493401193725     | ... | 0.9419412237398    |
+-------------------+-------+--------------------+-----+--------------------+

Understanding Scores and Results
--------------------------------
In the above evaluation loop, ``train_scores`` contains the scores of ITE prediction on the train set for each replication.
To better understand what's happening inside, let's take a look at these intermediate scores::

    >>> pd.DataFrame(train_scores) # for better visualization

    #   pehe_score	mean_absolute
    0	0.893524	0.074874
    1	0.826433	0.200816
    2	0.909720	0.080099
    3	1.945077	0.091223
    4	2.671555	0.466394
    ...	...	        ...
    95	2.194153	0.180240
    96	2.161083	0.087108
    97	13.238825	1.218813
    98	3.917264	0.054858
    99	2.538756	0.654481

And we then summarize these scores using different formats (like ``np.mean``, ``np.std``, ...)::

    >>> train_result = summarize_scores(train_scores)
    >>> pd.DataFrame([train_result])

which yields:

+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+
| pehe_score-mean | pehe_score-median | pehe_score-std | ... | mean_absolute-std |
+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+
| 5.592356        | 2.569472          | 8.248291       | ... | 0.524395          |
+-----------------+-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+

Simplifying Evaluation
----------------------
There's two things we can make a lot simpler using JustCause:

 1. Standard methods can be used as-is
 2. Standard evaluation is pre-implemented

Using the standard evaluation looks like this::

    from justcause.evaluation import evaluate_ite
    result = evaluate_ite(replications,
                          methods,
                          metrics,
                          train_size=train_size,
                          random_state=random_state)

And, we can also get rid of ``basic_slearner`` since that is the default usage of a learner:
fit on train, predict on train and test without special settings or parameters. Instead, we simply
pass the instantiation of the ``SLearner`` along to the methods parameter. Similarly, we can add all other
methods provided by JustCause::

    from justcause.learners import TLearner, XLearner, RLearner

    # All in standard configuration
    methods = [SLearner(), weighted_slearner, TLearner(), XLearner(), RLearner()]
    result = evaluate_ite(replications,
                          methods,
                          metrics,
                          train_size=train_size,
                          random_state=random_state)


.. note:: Note that all Meta Learners use a default setting to determine which regression to use when none is provided.

Implementing New Data
=====================
JustCause provides some of the most common reference dataset, but is open for extension. You can either provide fixed reference datasets or
define a parametric data generation process (DGP) that generates new data.

Providing Datasets
------------------
In the `JustCause Data Repository`_ we provide datasets in the ``.parquet`` format, which is highly efficient and can easily be read by Pandas.
In order to avoid duplicate data we store covariates and outcomes in separate files and only join them upon loading.
This is to say that usually we have a fixed set of covariates for a number of instances.
In the outcomes file we define factual outcomes and counterfactual for these instances for one or multiple replications.


.. note::
    If you have a new reference dataset or a useful set of covariates and want to allow others to use it,
    feel free to submit a Pull Request in the `JustCause Data Repository`_ and this repo. See :mod:`.data.sets.ihdp` for an example.
    In :mod:`.data.transport` we provide useful methods for fetching data. You only have to add the top level access and the respective
    directory in ``justcause-data``.

If you only want to use your data once, you can simply load it directly into a CausalFrame as shown in section :ref:`handling-data`.

Parametric DGPs
---------------
Another way to generate data is by defining the functions of the potential outcomes based on the covariates. This allows to sample as many replications as one requires.
Let's walk through an example to see what parts are required. Let's assume with work with the covariates from the IHDP study provided in :mod:`.data.sets.ihdp`.

.. note::
    For a fully fledged DGP we need:

     1. Covariates
     2. Potential Outcomes with and without noise
     3. Treatment Assignment

Covariates
""""""""""
We simply access the covariates with::

    >>> from justcause.data.sets.ihdp import get_ihdp_covariates

    >>> covariates = get_ihdp_covariates()
    >>> covariates.shape
        (747, 25)

Outcomes
""""""""
Let's define the outcome based on the following function:

.. math::
    y_0 &= N(0, 0.2) \\
    y_1 &= y_0 + \tau \\


where

.. math::
    c &= \mathbb{I}(sigmoid(X_8) > 0.5) \\
    \tau &= N(3*c + (1 - c), 0.1).

To implement that as a DGP in JustCause we define the outcome function as follows::

    from sklearn.utils import check_random_state  # ensures usable random state

    def outcome(covariates, *, random_state: RandomState, **kwargs):
        random_state = check_random_state(random_state)

        # define tau
        prob = expit(covariates[:, 7]) > 0.5
        tau = random_state.normal((3 * prob) + 1 * (1 - prob), 0.1)

        y_0 = random_state.normal(0, 0.2, size=len(covariates))
        y_1 = y_0 + _multi_modal_effect(covariates, random_state)
        mu_0, mu_1 = y_0, y_1  # no noise for this example
        return mu_0, mu_1, y_0, y_1

.. hint::
    Every outcome function you want to use with JustCause must take a ``covariates`` parameter and a ``random_state``. Using the
    ``**kwargs``, you can pass further parameters to the outcome and treatment assignemnt function.
    The outcome function must return all four potential outcomes (with and without noise).

Treatment
"""""""""
In order to get a confounded example, we assign treatment based on the covariates ``X_8`` that was already used to define
the strength of the treatment effect.

.. math::
    t = \text{BERN}[sigmoid(X_8)]


As a function this is simply::

    def treatment(covariates, *, random_state: RandomState, **kwargs):
        random_state = check_random_state(random_state)
        return random_state.binomial(1, p=expit(covariates[:, 7]))

.. hint::
    The treatment function also has to accept ``covariates`` and ``random_state`` arguments and should return
    the treatment indicator vector for the given covariates. Again, ``**kwargs`` can be used to pass further parameters

Plugging it Together
""""""""""""""""""""
With the covariates we fetched and the outcomes we defined,
we can now sample data from that DGP using the powerful :meth:`~justcause.data.utils.generate_data`::

    >>> replications = generate_data(
        covariates,
        treatment,
        outcome,
        n_samples=747,  # Optional but 747 is the maximum available with IHDP covariates
        n_replications=100,
        random_state=0,  # Fix random_state for replicability
        **kwargs=None,  # Use if further parameters are required
    )

A standardized Terminology
--------------------------
By using :meth:`~justcause.data.utils.generate_data` we encourage a consistent terminology for DGPs. This is important as
we've found that different researchers use different formalizations that are technically identical. However, assuring that they are actually
the same requires one to transform the notation.

Take for example the synthetic example studies in the `RLearner Paper`_ where outcomes are defined as

.. math::

    y_i = b(X) + (W - 0.5) \cdot \tau(X) + \sigma \epsilon(X).

That is to say, they start from a base value :math:`b(X)` and add or substract half the treatment effect :math:`\tau(X)`
depending on the treatment. This can be defined equivalently in our terminology as:

.. math::
    \mu_{0} = b(X) - \frac{1}{2}\cdot \tau, \\
    \mu_{1} = b(X) + \frac{1}{2}\cdot \tau, \\
    y_{0} = \mu_{0} + \sigma \epsilon(X), \\
    y_{1} = \mu_{1} + \sigma \epsilon(X).

We encourage users of JustCause to start their considerations with the terminology introduced at the top of this document.
