class Automation(TrackedAction):
    """
    An Automation is used to run a sequence of Steps. For an Automation, you need to specify what the first step to
    run is.

    An Automation instance is callable. When called, it will run the first Step, get the next_step from
    that first step, and loop through running and retrieving the next Step to run, until there are no more Steps to run.

    The IfStep enables decision making in an Automation

    The Automation class is also important, because all the arguments for all the Steps must be passed into the
    Automation on instantiation, and these arguments may potentially be updated by the Steps. All these arguments for
    the CustomSteps must be passed into an Automation sequence as a dictionary, where the keys are the argument names
    and the values are the initial values for these arguments. These arguments get stored as self.kwargs in the
    Automation instance, and self.kwargs gets used as the arguments to run the CustomSteps. If the CustomStep run
    function has a return value, it MUST be a dictionary, where the keys are argument names (that must correspond to
    a key in the self.kwargs dictionary of the Automation instance), and the values are the new values for the
    arguments; and in this way the arguments for the Automation instance can be updated.

    In short for using the Automation and Steps classes:
    * An Automation instantiation MUST include a dictionary of arguments and initial values to be used by the Steps
        in the Automation, unless no variables need to be passed between/used by multiple Steps
    * The parameter names for all the functions of CustomSteps must be identical to the keys in the kwargs
        dictionary that get passed into an Automation instance on instantiation
    * The return value of any CustomStep must be a dictionary, with the keys being identical to the keys in the
        kwargs dictionary of the Automation instance, and the values are the updated values
    * All these functions for the CustomSteps must also have a **kwargs parameter, to catch arguments that get passed
        through that are not actually required by the functions.
    * An Automation instance must know what the first step to run is
    * Steps need to be 'chained' to each other
