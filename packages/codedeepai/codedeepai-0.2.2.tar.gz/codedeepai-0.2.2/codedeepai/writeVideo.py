#declare the class to handle video writing
#this class encapsulates the video writer class from OpenCV. The video save from OpenCV
#fails silently for number of reasons, a few of which are:
#1. Mismatch in video frame size when video writer class was created Vs whats being saved
#2. Mismatch in file extension with which the file is being saved and video encoding
#Can be other reasons as well, most of the errors I made were generally with these 2 reasons
#Hence this class tries to take care of these 2 common scenarios. Also it adds a feature
#to save the video between a particular time frame. Look at documentation of save funtion
#for further details

class writeVideo:


    #Ctor that takes following arguments
    #filepath - path to save the video file
    #capture - video capture class object from OpenCV
    #currentframe - current frame of the video. This may not be passed when creating
    #    the object of the class. As most of the times the processing of video is not
    #    initiated when creating the object of this class.

    #elapsedtime: Default value is -1. This indicates the lenght of video to be saved
    #        starting from starttime. -1 means full duration of video needs to be saved
