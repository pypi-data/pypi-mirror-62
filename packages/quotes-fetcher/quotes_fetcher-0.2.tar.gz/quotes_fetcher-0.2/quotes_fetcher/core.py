"""
This library will allow you to perform the following actions:
- Fetch market data for a specified list of tickers and time interval.
Available data points: Open, High, Low, Close,Volume

- Time interval can be set in two ways:
-- period like 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, etc. 1mo is used by default.
-- period specified by start and end dates in format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The second option has a higher priority if specified.

- Get the fetched data as a Pandas Dataframe. Two view modes are available:
-- Regular (index consists of dates and columns are represented as two levels -
symbols and data points). Used by default.
-- Transposed (columns are represented as dates and index consists of two levels -
symbol and data points).

- Calculate the following date points: Average Close Price, Average Volume,
Average Daily Dollar Trade Volume, Beta-coefficient
