**Implements communication with REDCap.**

(Thoughts from 2019-01-27, RNC.)

- For general information about REDCap, see https://www.project-redcap.org/.

- The API documentation seems not to be provided there, but is available from
  your local REDCap server. Pick a project. Choose "API" from the left-hand
  menu.

- In Python, we have PyCap (https://pycap.readthedocs.io/ or
  https://github.com/redcap-tools/PyCap). See also
  http://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/.

- There are also Python examples in the "API Examples" section of the API
  documentation. See, for example, ``import_records.py``.

*REDCap concepts*

- **Project:** the basic security grouping. Represents a research study.

- **Arms:** not an abbreviation. Groups study events into a sequence (an "arm"
  of a study). See
  https://labkey.med.ualberta.ca/labkey/wiki/REDCap%20Support/page.view?name=rcarms.

- **Instruments:** what we call tasks in CamCOPS. Data entry forms.

- **Metadata/data dictionary:** you can download all the fields used by the
  project.

- **REDCap Shared Library:** a collection of public instruments.

*My exploration*

- A "record" has lots of "instruments". The concept seems to be a "study
  visit". If you add three instruments to your project (e.g. a PHQ-9 from the
  Shared Library plus a couple of made-up things) then it will allow you to
  have all three instruments for Record 1.

- Each instrument can be marked complete/incomplete/unverified etc. There's a
  Record Status Dashboard showing these by record ID. Record ID is an integer,
  and its field name is ``record_id``. This is the first variable in the data
  dictionary.

- The standard PHQ-9 (at least, the most popular in the Shared Library) doesn't
  autocalculate its score ("Enter Total Score:")...

- If you import a task from the Shared Library twice, you get random fieldnames
  like this (see ``patient_health_questionnaire_9b``):

  .. code-block:: none

    record_id	                my_first_instrument

*The REDCap API*

- The basic access method is a URL for a server/project plus a project-specific
  security token.

- Note that the API allows you to download the data dictionary.

*Other summaries*

- https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI/wiki/Importing-Data-to-REDCap is good.

*So, for an arbitrary CamCOPS-to-REDCap mapping, we'd need:*

#.  An export type of "redcap" with a definition including a URL and a project
    token.

#.  A configurable patient ID mapping, e.g. mapping CamCOPS forename to a
    REDCap field named ``forename``, CamCOPS ID number 7 to REDCap field
    ``my_study_id``, etc.

#.  Across all tasks, a configurable CamCOPS-to-REDCap field mapping
    (potentially incorporating value translation).

    - A specimen translation could contain the "default" instrument fieldnames,
      e.g. "phq9_1" etc. as above.

    - This mapping file should be separate from the patient ID mapping, as the
      user is quite likely to want to reuse the task mapping and alter the
      patient ID mapping for a different study.

    - UNCLEAR: how REDCap will cope with structured sub-data for tasks.

#.  A method for batching multiple CamCOPS tasks into the same REDCap record,
    e.g. "same day" (configurable?), for new uploads.

#.  Perhaps more tricky: a method for retrieving a matching record to add a
    new task to it.
