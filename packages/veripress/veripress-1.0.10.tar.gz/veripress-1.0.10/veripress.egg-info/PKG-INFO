        VeriPress is a blog engine for hackers, which is very similar to Octopress and Hexo, but with some different features. It's written in Python 3.4+ based on Flask web framework. Here is a [demo](https://veripress.github.io/demo/).
        
        ## Features
        
        - Supports three publish types: post, page, widget
        - Theme management
        - Custom post/page layout
        - Supports Markdown, HTML and plain TXT
        - Run as dynamic web app
        - Generating static HTML pages
        - API mode
        - Atom feed
        - and more...
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        It's dead easy to get started with VeriPress:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip3 install veripress  # Install VeriPress
        $ mkdir ~/my-veripress  # Create an empty folder as a VeriPress instance
        $ cd ~/my-veripress
        $ veripress init  # Initialize the VeriPress instance
        $ veripress theme install default  # Install the "default" theme
        $ veripress preview  # Preview the instance
        ```
        
        Run the above commands and then you can visit the very initial VeriPress instance at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
        
        See [documentation](https://veripress.github.io/docs/) for more information on how to use VeriPress.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Documentation is now available in [Simplified Chinese (简体中文)](https://veripress.github.io/docs/), and the English version is coming soon.
        
        ## Themes
        
        There are some official themes [here](https://github.com/veripress/themes), and also a theme collection [here](https://stdrc.cc/post/2018/10/13/collection-of-veripress-themes/) (in Simplified Chinese).
