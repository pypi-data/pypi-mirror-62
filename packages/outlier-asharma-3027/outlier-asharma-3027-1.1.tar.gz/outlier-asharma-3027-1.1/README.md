## InterQuartile Range (IQR) Description

Any set of data can be described by its five-number summary. These five numbers, which give you the information you need to find patterns and outliers, consist of:

The minimum or lowest value of the dataset.
<br>
The first quartile Q1, which represents a quarter of the way through the list of all data.
<br>
The median of the data set, which represents the midpoint of the whole list of data.
<br>
The third quartile Q3, which represents three-quarters of the way through the list of all data.
<br>
The maximum or highest value of the data set.
<br>
<br>
These five numbers tell a person more about their data than looking at the numbers all at once could, or at least make this much easier.

## Calculation of IQR

IQR = Q3 – Q1
<br>
MIN = Q1 - (1.5*IQR)
<br>
MAX = Q3 + (1.5*IQR)
<br>


## Sample dataset

Marks | Students 
:------------: | :-------------:
3 | Student1
57 | Student2
65 | Student3
98 | Student4
43 | Student5
44 | Student6
54 | Student7
99 | Student8
1 | Student9

<br>


## Output Dataset after Removal

Marks | Students 
:------------: | :-------------:
57 | Student2
65 | Student3
98 | Student4
43 | Student5
44 | Student6
54 | Student7

<br>

It is clearly visible that the rows containing Student1, Student8 and Student9 have been removed due to them being Outliers.
