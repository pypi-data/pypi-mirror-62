        ## InterQuartile Range (IQR) Description
        
        Any set of data can be described by its five-number summary. These five numbers, which give you the information you need to find patterns and outliers, consist of:
        
        The minimum or lowest value of the dataset.
        <br>
        The first quartile Q1, which represents a quarter of the way through the list of all data.
        <br>
        The median of the data set, which represents the midpoint of the whole list of data.
        <br>
        The third quartile Q3, which represents three-quarters of the way through the list of all data.
        <br>
        The maximum or highest value of the data set.
        <br>
        <br>
        These five numbers tell a person more about their data than looking at the numbers all at once could, or at least make this much easier.
        
        ## Calculation of IQR
        
        IQR = Q3 â€“ Q1
        <br>
        MIN = Q1 - (1.5*IQR)
        <br>
        MAX = Q3 + (1.5*IQR)
        <br>
        
        
        ## Sample dataset
        
        Marks | Students 
        :------------: | :-------------:
        3 | Student1
        57 | Student2
        65 | Student3
        98 | Student4
        43 | Student5
        44 | Student6
        54 | Student7
        99 | Student8
        1 | Student9
        
        <br>
        
        
        ## Output Dataset after Removal
        
        Marks | Students 
        :------------: | :-------------:
        57 | Student2
        65 | Student3
        98 | Student4
        43 | Student5
        44 | Student6
        54 | Student7
        
        <br>
        
        It is clearly visible that the rows containing Student1, Student8 and Student9 have been removed due to them being Outliers.
