Description: # napalm-gaia
        
        Inofficial CheckPoint GaiaOS driver-plugin for NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) python library.<br> 
        Certain commands will require expert password. <br>
        This driver is not slightly feature complete and must be considered as experimental, check the docs what is possible at the moment.
        
        We are not related to the official NAPALM Developer-Team. You will find them here:<br>
