# Exploring the Sine function

## Period 
When you first open the module, the sliders at set to amplitude _A_ = 1 and period &omega = 2&pi. Looking at the graph from _x_ = 0&pi to _x_ = 6&pi, where does it appear the sine function crosses the x-axis?

```





```

Using what you learned in the companion "Theory" document, describe with mathematics why the function crosses the x-axis at 2&pi:

```





```

If we were to increase the period of the sine function to 8&pi, where do you expect the sine function to cross the x-axis?

```





```

Does it work?
