Description: 
        The Distant TV Toolkit is a Python package designed to facilitate the
        computational analysis of visual culture. It contains low-level architecture
        for applying state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to still and moving
        images. The higher-level functionality of the toolkit allows users to quickly
        extract semantic metadata from digitized collections. Extracted information
        can be visualized for search and discovery or aggregated and analyzed to find
        patterns across a corpus.
