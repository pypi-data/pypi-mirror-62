        Description
        ===========
        
        The speed of **convtools** comes from the approach of generating code & compiling
        conversion functions, which don't have any generic code like superfluous
        loops, ifs, etc.
        
        So you can follow the DRY principle by storing and reusing the code on the
        python expression level, but at the same time be able to run the
        ``gen_converter`` and get the compiled code which doesn't care about being DRY
        and is generated to be highly specialized for the specific need.
        
        Thanks to pipes & labels it's possible to define multiple pipelines of data
        processing, including branching and merging of them.
        
        Conversions are not limited to simple data transformations, there are
        ``GroupBy`` & ``Aggregate`` conversions with many useful reducers:
        
         * from common `Sum`, `Max`
         * and less widely supported `First`/`Last`, `Array`/`ArrayDistinct`
         * to `DictSum`-like ones (for nested aggregation) and `MaxRow`/`MinRow`
           (for finding an object with max/min value and further processing)
        
        Every conversion:
         * contains the information of how to transform an input
         * can be **piped** into another conversion (same as wrapping)
         * can be labeled to be reused further in the conversions chain
         * has a method ``gen_converter`` returning a function compiled at runtime
         * despite being compiled at runtime, is debuggable with `pdb` due to `linecache` populating.
