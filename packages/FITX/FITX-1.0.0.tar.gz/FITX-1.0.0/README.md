# FITX
Fit my InsTability eXponential

A library to isolate and fit exponential rise times in unstable systems with saturation.

## How To

Check out the jupyter notebook [HowTo.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aoeftiger/FITX/blob/master/HowTo.ipynb) for a quick start how to do this:

## Thanks...

... for checking out the repository, I hope the algorithm as useful to you as to me -- it's been successfully applied to instability studies in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (and other machines) in both simulations and experiments.
