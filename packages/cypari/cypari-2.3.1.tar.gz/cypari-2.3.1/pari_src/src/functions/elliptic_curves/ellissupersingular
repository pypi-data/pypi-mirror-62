C-Name: ellissupersingular
Prototype: iGDG
Help: ellissupersingular(E,{p}): decide whether the elliptic curve E, defined
 over a number field or a finite field, is supersingular at p or not.
Doc:
 Return 1 if the elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field
 or a finite field is supersingular at $p$, and $0$ otherwise.
 If the curve is defined over a number field, $p$ must be explicitly given,
 and must be a prime number, resp.~a maximal ideal, if the curve is defined
 over $\Q$, resp.~a general number field: we return $1$ if and only if $E$
 has supersingular good reduction at $p$.

 Alternatively, $E$ can be given by its $j$-invariant in a finite field. In
 this case $p$ must be omitted.

 \fun{int}{elljissupersingular}{GEN j} where $j$ is a $j$-invariant of a curve
 over a finite field.
