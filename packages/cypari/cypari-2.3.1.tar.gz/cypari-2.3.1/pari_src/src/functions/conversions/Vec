C-Name: gtovec0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: Vec(x, {n}): transforms the object x into a vector of dimension n.
Description:
 (gen):vec        gtovec($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a row vector. The dimension of the
 resulting vector can be optionally specified via the extra parameter $n$.

 If $n$ is omitted or $0$, the dimension depends on the type of $x$; the
 vector has a single component, except when $x$ is

 \item a vector or a quadratic form: returns the initial object considered as a
 row vector,

 \item a polynomial or a power series: returns a vector consisting of the coefficients.
 In the case of a polynomial, the coefficients of the vector start with the leading
 coefficient of the polynomial, while for power series only the significant coefficients
 are taken into account, but this time by increasing order of degree.
 \kbd{Vec} is the reciprocal function of \kbd{Pol} for a polynomial and of
 \kbd{Ser} for a power series,

 \item a matrix: returns the vector of columns comprising the matrix,

 \item a character string: returns the vector of individual characters,

 \item a map: returns the vector of the domain of the map,

 \item an error context (\typ{ERROR}): returns the error components, see
 \tet{iferr}.

 In the last four cases (matrix, character string, map, error), $n$ is
 meaningless and must be omitted or an error is raised. Otherwise, if $n$ is
 given, $0$ entries are appended at the end of the vector if $n > 0$, and
 prepended at the beginning if $n < 0$. The dimension of the resulting vector
 is $|n|$. Variant: \fun{GEN}{gtovec}{GEN x} is also available.
