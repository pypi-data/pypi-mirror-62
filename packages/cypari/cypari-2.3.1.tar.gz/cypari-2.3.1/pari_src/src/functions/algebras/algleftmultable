Help: algleftmultable(al,x): left multiplication table of x.
Doc: Given an element \var{x} in \var{al}, computes its left multiplication
 table. If \var{x} is given in basis form, returns its multiplication table on
 the integral basis; if \var{x} is given in algebraic form, returns its
 multiplication table on the basis corresponding to the algebraic form of
 elements of \var{al}. In every case, if \var{x} is a \typ{COL} of length $n$,
 then the output is a $n\times n$ \typ{MAT}.
 Also accepts a square matrix with coefficients in \var{al}.
