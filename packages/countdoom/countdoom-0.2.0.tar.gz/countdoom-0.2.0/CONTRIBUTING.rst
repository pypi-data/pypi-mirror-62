such.

Submit feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/renemarc/countdoom/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

  are welcome üòÉ

Get started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up |Countdoom| for local
development.

**Note:** While |Countdoom| runs on Python 3.5+, dev tools require Python 3.6+
to run.

1. Fork the
   `Countdoom repo on GitHub <https://github.com/renemarc/countdoom/>`_.
2. Clone your fork locally:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/countdoom.git

3. Create a `virtual environment
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ for local development:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd countdoom/
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ . .venv/bin/activate

4. Install your local copy with all dependencies using pip:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install -e .[dev]

  Alternatively, you can also use ``setup.py`` to install the above
  requirements:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install --upgrade setuptools
        $ python setup.py develop

5. Create a branch for local development:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

  Now you can make your changes locally!

6. To help you test your code, you can use
`pyenv version manager <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ to install
concurrent Python versions in local virtual environments (unless already
installed):

  .. code-block:: console

        $ pyenv install "3.5.9"
        $ pyenv install "3.6.10"
        $ pyenv install "3.7.6"
        $ pyenv install "3.8.1"
        $ pyenv install "pypy3.6-7.3.0"
        $ pyenv local "3.5.9" "3.6.10" "3.7.6" "3.8.1" "pypy3.6-7.3.0"

7. When you're done making changes, you can test the results with `makefile
<https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`_. This will verify that
your changes pass the opinionated code-quality gauntlet üõ°Ô∏è:

  - `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ code formatter
  - `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/>`_ style enforcer
  - `isort <https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ imports checker
  - `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ static type checker
  - `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ code analyser
  - `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ python tests
  - `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ multi-version automated testing tool

  .. code-block:: console

        $ make test-all
        $ make coverage

  Alternatively, you can run the test suites individually:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ black --check --diff .
        $ flake8
        $ isort --check -rc .
        $ mypy
        $ pylint setup.py countdoom examples
        $ pylint --disable=E0401 tests/*.py
        $ pytest
        $ tox -e py35
        $ tox -e py36
        $ tox -e py37
        $ tox -e py38
        $ tox -e pypy3
        $ coverage

8. Commit your changes using `Conventional Commits
<https://www.conventionalcommits.org/>`_ comment style and push your branch to
GitHub. To help catch any gotchas, `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ will
automatically run various code quality linters on any modified files:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "type(scope): detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. `Submit a pull request
<https://github.com/renemarc/countdoom/pulls>`_ through the GitHub website.

Pull request guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in ``README.md`` (repo) and ``README.rst`` (docs).
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and for PyPy3.
   Check https://travis-ci.com/renemarc/countdoom/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest tests.test_countdoom


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in `HISTORY.rst
<https://github.com/renemarc/countdoom/blob/master/HISTORY.rst>`_).
Then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ bumpversion patch # possible: major / minor / patch
    $ git push
    $ git push --tags

`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.com/renemarc/countdoom>`__ will then deploy to
the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/countdoom/>`__ if tests
pass.
