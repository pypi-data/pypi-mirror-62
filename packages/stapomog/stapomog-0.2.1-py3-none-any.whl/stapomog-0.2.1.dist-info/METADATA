A quick tool to generate static portrait mods for Crusader Kings 2.

## Install

Install with `pip install stapomog`. Make sure to use `pip3` if Python 3 isn't your default version.


## Use

Copy all your image files into a folder (you can use arbitrary subfolders for organization). There's no need to crop them into circles, but make sure your character's face is somewhat centered. Name the files following the pattern `name_agerange_trait.ext`. Everything after the first dot is ignored, so you can have multiple files with the same attributes.

Example:

	hannah_20-30.png # will be used for the "hannah" portrait between ages 20 and 30
	steve_mid.jpg	# will be used for the "steve" portrait for middle age (30-49)
	mike_35-40.alternate.jpeg # will be used for the "mike" portrait between ages 35 and 40
	emily_-30_fair.png # will be used for the "emily" portrait up to age 30 if she's attractive
	tiffany.jpg # will be used for the "tiffany" portrait at any age
	gilly_young_wilding.png # will be used for the "gilly" portrait for young age (16-29) if she has the "wildling" trait

Then simply run the command `stapomog (folder)`. It will generate a new mod in the folder `stapomog_portrait_mod`. Merge this folder with your existing mod or use it as a standalone mod (make sure to create a .mod file).

You can now assign the new portraits by adding traits with events, decisions or console commands - they are simply named `portrait_(name)`. If you set the global flag `debug_stapomog`, you can directly assign portraits to any living person by right-clicking them.

If you add additional pictures, you can simply update your existing mod (even if you moved and renamed it) by running `stapomog (modfolder)`. Keep in mind that updating mods midgame will break your savegames if traits are added or removed.
