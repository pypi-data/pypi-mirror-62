Description: # ServiceX Command Line Tool
        This is a tool for setting up the serviceX cluster. 
        
        Its only function for now is to install your grid certs and passphrase
        securely as kubernetes secrets.
        
        ## Installation
        The tool is available on pypi so...
        ```bash
        pip install servicex-cli
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To list the version of the servicex cli installed:
        ```bash
        servicex version
        ```
        
        ### Install Certs
        To install your grid certs
        ```bash
        servicex init
        ```
        By default, it will find certs in `.globus` in your home directory. You can 
        override this by providing a `--cert-dir` command line option.
        
        By default the secret will be created in the `default` namespace. You can
        override this by providing a `--namespace` command line option.
        
        When the script runs it will prompt you for your grid cert passphrase. This 
        will not be echoed to the screen, but will be stored in the kubernetes secret.
        
        ### Remove Certs
        If you want to remove the installed certs and passphrase from the cluster then
        you can use:
        ```bash
        servicex clear
        ```
        
        It takes the same `--namespace` argument as the `init` command to remove the 
        secret from that namespace.
