# smommit
The CLI tool for forgetful gits. 

### What is it? 
- If you don't want to `git commit` just yet then why not make a smommit (small commit)
- If your're like me and can't remember what you have changed in a commit then whenever you have made a change just call `smommit add -m <change>`. This will create a `.smommit` directory and a "smommit" file (for the current branch your on) which stores all your small commits ready for the big one.
- Then when you call `git commit` the commit message will be filled out with all those lovely smommits that you have collected (the smommit file will also be overwritten ready for your new smommits)
- Smommits also come with a `config.json` which allows you to access the formatting options for the smommit for that branch
  - Current supported formatting options:
    - `datetime`: if true then will add a timestamp at the end of the message in the format `("%d/%m/%Y - %X")`
    - `list-hyphons`: if true then will add a hyphon to the start of the message (like a list item)

#### Available commands:
```
    # For adding a smommit message to the smommit file of the current branch
