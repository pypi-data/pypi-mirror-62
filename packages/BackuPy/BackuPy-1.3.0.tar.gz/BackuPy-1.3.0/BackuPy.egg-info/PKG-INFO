Description: # BackuPy
        ## Features
        - Backup, Mirror, and Sync Modes
        - Compare files using attributes or CRCs
        - Files are always archived before being deleted or overwritten by default
        - JSON formatted database for tracking files
        - Concise logs as csv files
        - Save and load your configuration
        - Perform a dry run to test your configuration
        - Works on both new and existing backup directories
        - Filter files with regular expressions
        ## Under the hood
        - Easy to use in scripts
        - Clear and easy to verify code, the only functions that touch your files are: copyFile(), moveFile(), and  removeFile()
        - Console version uses only the Python standard library
        - GUI available through Gooey and PySimpleGUI
        ## Usage Description
        - Source and destination directories can be any accessible directory
        - Destination can be empty or contain files from a previous backup, matching files on both sides will be skipped
        - Main modes (how to handle new and deleted files)
          - Backup mode: copies files that are only in source to destination
          - Mirror mode: copies files that are only in source to destination and deletes files that are only in destination
          - Sync mode: copies files that are only in source to destination and copies files that are only in destination to source
        - Selection modes (which file to select in cases where different versions exist on both sides)
          - Source mode: copy source files to destination
          - Destination mode: copy destination files to source
          - Newer mode: copy newer files based on last modified time
          - None mode: don't copy either, differing files will only be logged for manual intervention
        - Compare modes (how to detect which files have changed)
          - Attribute mode: compare file attributes (size and last modified time)
          - Attribute+ mode: compare file attributes and calculate CRCs only for new and changed files for future verification
          - CRC mode: compare file attributes and CRC for every file, and checks previously stored CRCs to detect corruption
        - Test your settings first with the 'norun' flag
        ## Command Line Interface
        ```
        usage: backupy [options] -- <source> <dest>
               backupy <source> <dest> [options]
               backupy <source> --load [--norun]
               backupy -h | --help
