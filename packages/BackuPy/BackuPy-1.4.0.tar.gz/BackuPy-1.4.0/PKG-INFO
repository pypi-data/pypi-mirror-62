Description: # BackuPy
        ## Quick Start
        ```
        pip install backupy
        backupy -h
        ```
        ## Installation
        - Install the latest version from PyPI
        ```
        pip install backupy --upgrade
        ```
        - Or install the python package from the GitHub release page
        - Or run the python file directly, all you need is backupy.py
        - Or run it with the GUI, in which case you run backupy_gui.py from the same directory as backupy.py
        - Or you can run BackuPy-Setup.exe from the GitHub release page to install it with the GUI for Windows 
        ## Features
        - Backup, Mirror, and Sync Modes
        - Compare files using attributes or CRCs
        - Detection and alerts of corrupted files
        - JSON formatted database for tracking files (human readable and easy to parse)
        - Detection and alerts of unexpected file modifications on destination outside of backups and mirrors, or sync conflicts (a file was modified on both sides since the last sync)
        - Files are always copied to an identically structured archive directory before being deleted or overwritten by default
        - Easy to read logs as csv files
        - Save and load your configuration
        - Perform a dry run to test your configuration
        - Works on both new and existing backup directories
        - Filter file paths with regular expressions
        ## Under the Hood
        - Easy to use in scripts (see backupy_batch.py for an example)
        - Clear and easy to verify code, the only functions that touch your files are: copyFile(), moveFile(), and  removeFile()
        - OS independent and console version only uses the Python standard library
        - GUI available through Gooey and PySimpleGUI
        ## Usage Description
        - Source and destination directories can be any accessible directory
        - Destination can be empty or contain files from a previous backup, matching files on both sides will be skipped
        - Main modes (how to handle new and deleted files)
          - Backup mode: copies files that are only in source to destination
          - Mirror mode: copies files that are only in source to destination and deletes files that are only in destination
          - Sync mode: copies files that are only in source to destination and copies files that are only in destination to source
        - Selection modes (which file to select in cases where different versions exist on both sides)
          - Source mode: copy source files to destination
          - Destination mode: copy destination files to source
          - Newer mode: copy newer files based on last modified time
          - None mode: don't copy either, differing files will only be logged for manual intervention
        - Compare modes (how to detect which files have changed)
          - Attribute mode: compare file attributes (size and last modified time)
          - Attribute+ mode: compare file attributes and calculate CRCs only for new and changed files for future verification
          - CRC mode: compare file attributes and CRC for every file, and checks previously stored CRCs to detect corruption
        - Test your settings first with the 'norun' flag
        ## Example Usage
        - Just type backupy followed by your source and destination directories, and any combination of options
        - If you're unsure how something works, include "--norun" to see what would happen without actually doing anything
        ```
        backupy "path/to/your/source directory/" "path/to/destination/" --norun
        ```
        ## Command Line Interface
        ```
        usage: backupy [options] -- <source> <dest>
               backupy <source> <dest> [options]
               backupy <source> --load [--norun]
               backupy -h | --help

          -ff regex [regex ...]
                       Filter False: Exclude files matching the regular expression(s)
                       (exclude has priority over include)
          --noarchive  Disable archiving files before overwriting/deleting to:
                         <source|dest>/.backupy/Archives/yymmdd-HHMM/
                         <source|dest>/.backupy/Trash/yymmdd-HHMM/
          --nolog      Disable writing to:

          --save       Save configuration to <source>/.backupy/config.json
          --load       Load configuration from <source>/.backupy/config.json
        ```
        ## Extra Configuration Options
        - Some options can only be set from the config file
          - archive_dir
            - can be any subdirectory, default = ".backupy/Archive"
          - config_dir
            - can't be changed under normal operation, default = ".backupy"
          - log_dir
            - can be any subdirectory, default = ".backupy/Logs"
          - trash_dir
            - can be any subdirectory, default = ".backupy/Trash"
          - cleanup_empty_dirs
            - delete directories when they become empty, default = True 
          - root_alias_log
            - replace source and dest paths with "\<source\>" and "\<dest\>" in logs, default = True
          - stdout_status_bar
            - show progress status bar, default = True
          - verbose
            - print more updates to stdout, default = True
          - force_posix_path_sep
            - always use a forward slash in paths, useful for keeping the same database on a drive shared between multiple operating systems, default = False
          - set_blank_crc_on_copy
            - normally database entries are copied along with files, this removes the CRC from the copied entry forcing BackuPy to calculate and check the CRC on the next run (with ATTR+) to ensure the copy was successful (CRC mode would calculate and check it regardless, but takes much longer since it would also recheck every file), default = False
          - quit_on_db_conflict
            - causes the run to automatically abort if there is any unexpected file modifications, sync conflicts, or file corruption detected, recommended if running with noprompt, default = False
        ## Building From Source
        - Run tests with
        ```
        python setup.py test
        ```
        - Building a python package
        ```
        python setup.py sdist
        ```
        - Building an executable with the GUI
        ```
        pyinstaller build.spec
        ```
        - You can package the executable on Windows by running setup.iss with Inno Setup
