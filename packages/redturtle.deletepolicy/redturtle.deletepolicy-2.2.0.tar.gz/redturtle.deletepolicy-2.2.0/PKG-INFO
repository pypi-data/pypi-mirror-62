Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Change some parts of Plone and make possible for users to delete contents not so easily.
        
        The Plone behaviour
        -------------------
        
        Plone (Zope) base the power to delete object looking for the "*Delete objects*" permission on *containers*.
        This mean that normally users that can delete contents inside a folder can delete **all** contents.
        In our experience, no-one want a workflow that make possibile to users that can't modify a content, to be able to delete it.
        
        This product change the Plone user interface behaviour, hiding the possibility to delete contents when you can't modify it.
        
        How Plone works after the installation
        --------------------------------------
        
        For deleting a content you must have:
        
        * "*Delete objects*" permission on the parent folder
        * "*Delete objects*" permission on the content itself
        * Beeing able to modify the content (*all* the contents) you want to delete
        
        Security
        --------
        
        This product is mainly targeted on Plone UI and it monkeypatch the low level permission for cutting documents.
        
        If you run a task, a 3rd party product or whatever piece of code that delete objects,
        this will run with the default Plone permissions (so, only checking the "*Delete objects*" on containers).
