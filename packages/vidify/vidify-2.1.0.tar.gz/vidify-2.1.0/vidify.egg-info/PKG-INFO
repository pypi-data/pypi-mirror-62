        ## Installation
        By default, Vidify includes the Spotify APIs and `python-vlc` for the player (you'll need [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) installed, too).
        
        * With [pip](https://pypi.org/project/vidify): `pip install --user vidify`. Optional APIs or Players can be installed with `pip install --user vidify[extra1,extra2]`. See the [APIs section](#the-apis) and the [Players section](#the-players) for all the extra dependencies available.
        * Otherwise, the [latest stable releases](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/releases) have pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Linux.
        * Other installation methods for Linux:
            * Any distro: you can use snap to install it: `snap install vidify-qt`.
            * Arch Linux: you can install it from the AUR: [`vidify`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vidify/). Maintained by me ([marioortizmanero](https://github.com/marioortizmanero)).
            * Gentoo: there's an e-build maintained by [AndrewAmmerlaan](https://github.com/AndrewAmmerlaan) at [media-video/vidify](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-video/vidify).
            * *Feel free to upload it to your distro's repositories! Let me know in an issue so that I can add it to this list.*
        
        *Note: Vidify requires Python >= 3.6.*
        
        ### The APIs
        An API is simply a source of information about the music playing on a device. For example, the Spotify desktop client, or iTunes. This app is built to support any API as easily as possible, because there are many different ways to play music. Here are the currently supported ones:
        
        | Name                                         | Wiki link                                                                 | Extra requirements              | Description |
        |----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---------------------------------|-------------|
        | Linux Media Players (`mpris_linux`)          | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/wiki/Linux-Media-Players)           | Installed by default (see wiki) | Any MPRIS compatible media player for Linux or BSD (99% of them, like Spotify, Clementine, VLC...). |
        | Spotify for Windows & MacOS (`swspotify`)    | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/wiki/Spotify-for-Windows-and-MacOS) | Installed by default            | The Spotify desktop app for Windows & MacOS, using the [SwSpotify](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify) library. |
        | Spotify Web (`spotify_web`)                  | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/wiki/Spotify-Web-API)               | Installed by default            | The official Spotify Web API, using [Tekore](https://github.com/felix-hilden/tekore). Check the wiki for more details on how to use it. |
        | Unknown (any other string)                   | -                                                                         | -                               | If you use any other string with `--api`, the initial screen to choose an API will appear again. This is temporary until the GUI menu is implemented. |
        
        The internal name inside parenthesis is used for the [arguments](#usage) and the [config](#the-config-file) options. `--api mpris_linux` would force using the Linux Media Players API, for instance.
        
        ### The players
        The embedded video players inside the app. Vidify uses external players because they already come with codecs installed. The default one is VLC because it's more popular, but you can use others if you have the player installed, and the Python extra dependencies. For example, to install Vidify with Mpv support, you'd run `pip install --user vidify[mpv]`, which installs `python-mpv`.
        
        | Name           | Extra requirements   | Description                                           | Arguments/config options                      |
        |----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        | VLC (`vlc`)    | Installed by default | The default video player. Widely used and very solid. |`--vlc-args <VLC_ARGS>`                        |
        | Mpv (`mpv`)    | `python-mpv`         | A simple and portable video player.                   | `--mpv-flags <MPV_ARGS>` (only boolean flags) |
        
        For now, the only way to specify what player to use is with [arguments](#usage) or inside the [config file](#the-config-file) with the internal name. You can use `--player mpv` or save it in your config file for future usage:
        
        ```ini
        [Defaults]
        player = mpv
        ```
        
        ### Audio synchronization
        Vidify has an audio synchronization feature currently under testing. The full repository is in [vidify/audiosync](https://github.com/vidify/audiosync), being a separate repo so that it can be installed optionally.
        
        This feature is only available on Linux for now. It's much more precise on a lightweight video player like Mpv. You can install it with `pip install vidify[audiosync]`, along with the following dependencies:
        
        * FFTW: `libfftw3` on Debian-based distros.
        * ffmpeg: `ffmpeg` on most repositories. It must be available on your path.
        * pulseaudio: `pulseaudio`, pre-installed on most repos.
        * youtube-dl: this is installed by default with Vidify, but make sure it's available on your path.
        
        It's also available as [`vidify-audiosync`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vidify-audiosync) on the AUR, and it comes pre-installed in the vidify snap.
        
        Finally, you can activate the feature with `--audiosync` or inside your [config file](#the-config-file):
        
        ```ini
        [Defaults]
        audiosync = true
        ```
        
        You can calibrate the audiosync results with the option `--audiosync-calibration` or `audiosync_calibration`. By default it's -800 milliseconds, but it may depend on your hardware.
        
        *Note: if when using audiosync there's no sound, you might need to disable stream target device restore by editing the corresponing line in `/etc/pulse/default.pa` to `load-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false`.*
        
        *Note 2: you should make sure that the sink being recorded is either `audiosync`, or the one where the music is playing. Here's an example on Pavucontrol (it's usually called 'Monitor of ...'):*
        
        ![pavucontrol](images/pavucontrol-audiosync.png)
        
        ## Usage
        The app has an interface that will guide you through most of the set-up, but you can use command line arguments and the config file for more advanced options (and until the GUI is completely finished).
        
        ```
        usage: vidify [-h] [-v] [--debug] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE] [-n] [-f] [--dark-mode] [--stay-on-top]
                      [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT] [-a API] [-p PLAYER] [--audiosync]
                      [--audiosync-calibration AUDIOSYNC_CALIBRATION] [--vlc-args VLC_ARGS]
                      [--mpv-flags MPV_FLAGS] [--client-id CLIENT_ID] [--client-secret CLIENT_SECRET]
                      [--redirect-uri REDIRECT_URI]
        ```
        
        | Argument                         | Description         |
        |----------------------------------|---------------------|
        | `-n`, `--no-lyrics`              | do not print lyrics. |
        | `-f`, `--fullscreen`             | play videos in fullscreen mode. |
        | `--dark-mode`                    | enables dark mode for the GUI. |
        | `--stay-on-top`                  | the app window will stay on top of other apps. |
        | `--width <WIDTH>`                | set the width for the downloaded videos (this is useful to play lower quality videos if your connection isn't good). |
        | `--height <HEIGHT>`              | set the height for the downloaded videos. |
        | `-a`, `--api`                    | specify the API to use. See the [APIs section](#the-apis) for more info about the supported APIs. |
        | `-p`, `--player`                 | specify the player to use. See the [Players section](#the-players) for more info about the supported players. |
        | `--audiosync`                    | enables the [Audio Synchronization](#audio-synchronization) feature (disabled by default). |
        | `--audiosync-calibration`        | You can calibrate the delay in milliseconds audiosync returns with this. It can be positive or negative. The default is 0ms. |
        | `--config-file <PATH>`           | indicate the path of your [config file](#the-config-file).  |
        
        ### The config file
        The configuration file is created by default at your usual config directory:
        
        * Linux: `~/.config/vidify/config.ini` (or in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if defined)
        * Mac OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/vidify/config.ini`
        * Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\vidify\vidify\config.ini`
        
        You can use a custom one by passing `--config-file <PATH>` as an argument. The config file is overriden by the configuration passed as arguments, but keeps your settings for future usage. [Here's an example of one](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/blob/master/example.ini). It uses the [INI config file formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). Most options are inside the `[Defaults]` section.
        
        All the available options for the config file are the same as the arguments listed in the [Usage section](#usage), except for `--config-file <PATH>`, which is only an argument. Their names are the same but with underscores instead of dashes. For example, `--use-mpv` would be equivalent to `use_mpv = true`.
        
        ## FAQ
        ### Vidify doesn't work correctly with Python 3.8 and PySide2
        PySide2 started supporting Python 3.8 with the 5.14 release. Make sure you're using an updated version and try again. `TypeError: 'Shiboken.ObjectType' object is not iterable` will be raised otherwise.
        
        ### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gi'` when using a virtual environment
        For some reason, `python-gobject` may not be available inside a virtual environment. You can create a symlink inside it with:
        
        ```bash
        ln -s "/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/gi" "$venv_dir/lib/python3.8/site-packages"
        ```
        
        or install it with pip following [this guide](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
        
        ### Vidify doesn't recognize some downloaded songs
        If the song doesn't have a metadata field with the title and the artist (the latter is optional), Vidify is unable to know what song is playing. Try to modify the metadata of your downloaded songs with VLC or any other tool.
