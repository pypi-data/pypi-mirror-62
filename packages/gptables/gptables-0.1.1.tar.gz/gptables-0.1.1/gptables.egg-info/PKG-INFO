Description: # Good Practice Tables (gptables)
        
        <!-- badges: start -->
        [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/best-practice-and-impact/gptables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/best-practice-and-impact/gptables)
        <!-- badges: end -->
        
        A wrapper for `xlsxwriter`, to write publication quality tables in Excel.
        
        ## Statement of intent
        
        `gptables` is a package developed for python and `reticulate` in R.
        It will help the production of `.xlsx` tables by automating the boring bits.
        We follow the Good Practice Team [guidance](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets) so that you don't have to.
        We cover up the workings of `xlsxwriter` so you don't have to do it cell-by-cell.
        
        ## Installation and use
        
        For development, clone this repository and install the package from a local repo using:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/gptables.git ./gptables/
        pip install -e gptables
        ```
        
        To uninstall, use:
        
        ```
        pip uninstall gptables
        ```
