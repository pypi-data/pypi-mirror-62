Files

This package contains :

  README VXI11.rpcl cVXI11.pyx cVXI11.pxd setup.py

  and some helper files.


How to build

  You must have rpcgen command, Cython, and python running on your
  system.

(If you also wants to build old VXI11.py and related library, you need
swig).

The following sequence of commands will build and install VXI11 module
in your python interpreter.

    %python setup.py build
    %python setup.py install 

or

    %sudo python setup.py install 

Before start building, pleas make sure thata there is none of VXI11.py,
VXI11_wrap.c, cVXI11.cpp, cVXI11.h, VXI11.h,VXI11_clnt.c,VXI11_svc.c and
VXI11_xdr.c. These files should be generated using the tools mentioned
above, ie rpcge, cython ,swig and are platform dependent. In other
words, these files created on other platforms may not work on your
platform.


binary tools

run "make all" to create vxi11scan and vxi11_device_clear. vxi11scan.py
nor pyvxi11scan.pyx are not support on this version.
