        Update or create a dns record through the DigitalOcean API.
        
        # Caveats
        
        This script makes the assumption that there is only one FQDN that matches a given combination of name and
        record type.
        So if you have two A records for foo.example.com, this script might fail or delete one of them, depending on what I 
        have implemented at that moment.
        
        Right now it simply sets all records that the DO API returned for the given combination to the given `--data`.
        I might even try to fix this shortcoming in the future. 
        
        Multiple `--type` arguments with their own address each for updating A and AAAA in one go would also be nice.
        
        It also exposes your DO API token in the process list while running. You have to trust your local machine.
