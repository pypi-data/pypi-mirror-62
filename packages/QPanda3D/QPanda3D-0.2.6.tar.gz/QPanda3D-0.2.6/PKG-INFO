Description: # QPanda3D
        A working Panda3D wrapper for PyQt5
        The objective is to be able to put on the same screen, panda3D and pyQT widgets.
        
        This package is still a work in progress.
        What works :
        - Creating a panda3D world inside a seemlessly QWidget object that can be placed alog with other QT stuff
        - Full access to panda3D objects, lights ...
        - Keyboard press and up are supported starting from v 0.5
        What doesn't work yet:
        - Mouse and timed keyboard interactions
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install QPanda3D
        ```
        ## Usage
        1 - create your world by inheriting from Panda3DWorld
        ```python
        from QPanda3D.Panda3DWorld import Panda3DWorld
        class MyWorld(Panda3DWorld):
                Panda3DWorld.__init__(self)
                # from this point, act as if you are defining a classic panda3D environment
                self.cam.setPos(0, -28, 6)
                self.testModel = loader.loadModel('panda')
                self.testModel.reparentTo(render)
        ```
        2 - In your main, just create an instance of your world, create a Q
        ```python
        from QPanda3D.QPanda3DWidget import QPanda3DWidget
        if __name__ == "__main__":    
            world = MyWorld() 
            
            app = QApplication(sys.argv)
            appw=QMainWindow()
            appw.setGeometry(50, 50, 800, 600)
        
            pandaWidget = QPanda3DWidget(world)
            appw.setCentralWidget(pandaWidget)
            appw.show()
            
            sys.exit(app.exec_())    
        
        ```
        
        ## Widget resizing policy
        Starting from V 0.4, the widget is automatically resized without making any stretching artefacts. Resizing policy parameters (introduced in V 0.2) have been removed since they are no more needed.
          
        ```python
        
        from QPanda3D.QPanda3DWidget import QPanda3DWidget
        if __name__ == "__main__":    
            world = MyWorld() 
            
            app = QApplication(sys.argv)
            appw=QMainWindow()
            appw.setGeometry(50, 50, 800, 600)
        
            pandaWidget = QPanda3DWidget(world)
            appw.setCentralWidget(pandaWidget)
            appw.show()
            
            sys.exit(app.exec_())    
        
        ```
        
        you can also tell the Panda3DWorld object what is the default view size that you prefer when creating it.
        
        ```python
        from QPanda3D.Panda3DWorld import Panda3DWorld
        class MyWorld(Panda3DWorld):
                Panda3DWorld.__init__(self, width=1024, height=768)
                # from this point, act as if you are defining a classic panda3D environment
                self.cam.setPos(0, -28, 6)
                self.testModel = loader.loadModel('panda')
                self.testModel.reparentTo(render)
        ```
        Just make sure that your ratio is adequate with your real widget size.
        
        ## TODO
        - Add mouse and keyboard interactions
