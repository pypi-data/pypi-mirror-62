Installation
============

You need Python 3.5 or higher. Install using ``pip``::

  pip install tomcatmanager

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Now what?

First you will need to :doc:`configuretomcat`.

If you are in a hurry to :doc:`get started with the command line tool
<interactive>`, type::

   tomcat-manager -h

Or, you can start :doc:`writing your own python code which imports the
package <package>`.
