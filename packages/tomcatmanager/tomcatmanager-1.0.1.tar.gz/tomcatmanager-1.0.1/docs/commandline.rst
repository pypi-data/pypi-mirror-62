Command Line
============

You've already read about :doc:`Interactive Use <interactive>` right? If not,
this part will feel kind of hollow.

Say you want to find out how many active sessions there are in the oldest
version of our ``shiny`` app (told you it would feel kind of hollow). You could
use interactive mode:

.. code-block:: text

  $ tomcat-manager
  tomcat-manager>connect https://www.example.com/manager ace newenglandclamchowder
  --connected to https://www.example.com/manager as ace
  tomcat-manager>list
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager
  /shiny                   running       17 shiny##v2.0.6
  /shiny                   running        6 shiny##v2.0.5


Using Shell Scripts
-------------------

If you need to automate a more complex sequence of commands or parse the
output, you might choose to use ``tomcat-manager`` from within a shell script:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  #
  URL=https://www.example.com/manager
  USERID=ace
  PASSWD=newenglandclamchowder
  COMMAND='list --raw'
  TOMCAT="tomcat-manager --quiet --user=$USERID --password=$PASSWD $URL $COMMAND"

  # get the output of the list into a shell variable
  LIST=$($TOMCAT)

  # if the tomcat command completed successfully
  TOMCAT_EXIT=$?
  if [ "$TOMCAT_EXIT" -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "$LIST" | grep '^/shiny' | awk -F ':' '{ print $4":"$3}' | \
      sort | head -1 | awk -F ':' '{ print #2 }'
  else
      # list has an error message, not the list of tomcat apps
      echo -n "$LIST"
      exit $TOMCAT_EXIT
  fi

Save this script as ``~/bin/oldshiners.sh``, and then run it:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ~/bin/oldshiners.sh
  6

This script builds a ``tomcat-manager`` command which includes authentication
credentials, the url where the Tomcat Manager web app is deployed, as well as
the command from :doc:`Interactive Use <interactive>`. In this example, we
used ``list`` as our command. Any command that works in the interactive mode
works on the command line.

Note how we check the exit code in the shell. ``tomcat-manager`` knows whether
the command to the tomcat server completed successfully or not, and sets the
shell exit code appropriately. The exit codes are:


  | **0** = command completed succesfully
  | **1** = command had an error
  | **2** = incorrect usage
  | **127** = unknown command


Server Shortcuts
----------------

You can use :ref:`server_shortcuts` from the command line with or without
commands:

.. code-block:: text

  $ tomcat-manager localhost
  --connected to http://localhost:8080/manager as ace
  tomcat-manager>list
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager

Or:

.. code-block:: text

  $ tomcat-manager localhost list
  --connected to http://localhost:8080/manager as ace
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager

This mechanism allows you to keep all authentication credentials out of your
scripts. Simply define shortcut(s) with credentials for the server(s) you want
to manage, and reference the shortcuts in your scripts. Instead of this:

.. code-block:: bash

  TOMCAT="tomcat-manager --user=$USERID --password=$PASSWD $URL $COMMAND"

you might use this:

.. code-block:: bash

  TOMCAT="tomcat-manager example $COMMAND"

with the following in your configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

  [example]
  url=https://www.example.com
  user=ace
  password=newenglandclamchowder


Piped Input
-----------

``tomcat-manager`` will process lines from standard input as though they were
entered at the interactive prompt. There is no mechanism to check for errors
this way, the commands are blindly run until the pipe is closed. The shell exit
code of ``tomcat-manager`` will be the exit code of the last command run.

If you want to see what the exit codes are, you can either use ``$?`` in your
shell, or you can use the interactive command ``exit_code`` (``$?`` works too)
to see the result.

If you want more sophisticated error checking, then you should probably write a
shell script and invoke ``tomcat-manager`` seperately for each command you want
to execute. That will allow you to use the shell script for checking exit
codes, logic branching, looping, etc.


Controlling Output
------------------

When using ``tomcat-manager`` from the command line, you have fine grained
control of what you want included in the output. As a well-behaved shell
program it sends output to ``stdout`` and errors to ``stderr``. If you are
using ``bash`` or one of the other ``sh`` variants, you can easily co-mingle
them into a single stream:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tomcat-manager localhost list > myapps.txt 2>&1

In addition to redirecting with the shell, there are several command line
switches that change what's included in the output. These options correspond to
:ref:`settings` you can change in :doc:`Interactive Use <interactive>`. All of
the settings default to ``False``, but be aware that you may have altered them
your :ref:`configuration_file`, which is read on startup.

==========================  ======================  ======================================
Option                      Setting                 Description
==========================  ======================  ======================================
``-e, --echo``              ``echo``                Add the command to the output stream.
``-q, --quiet``             ``quiet``               Don't show non-essential feedback.
``-s, --status-to-stdout``  ``status_to_stdout``    Send status information to ``stdout``
                                                    instead of ``stderr``.
``-d, --debug``             ``debug``               Show detailed exception and stack
                                                    trace, even if ``quiet`` is True.
==========================  ======================  ======================================

Some commands show additional status information during their execution which
is not part of the output. If ``quiet=True`` then all status output is
suppressed. If ``quiet=False`` then status information is sent to ``stderr``.
If ``status_to_stdout=True`` then status information is sent to ``stdout``, as
long as ``quiet=False``.

Here's a couple of examples to demonstrate, using a :ref:`server shortcut
<server_shortcuts>` of ``localhost``, which we assume gets you authenticated to
a Tomcat Server web application:

These two commands yield the same output, but by different mechanisms: the
first one uses the shell to redirect status messages to the bitbucket, the
second one uses the ``--quiet`` switch to instruct ``tomcat-manager`` to
suppress status messages.

.. code-block:: text

  $ tomcat-manager localhost list 2>/dev/null
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager
  $ tomcat-manager --quiet localhost list 2>/dev/null
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager

If you pipe commands into ``tomcat-manager`` instead of providing them as
arguments, the ``--echo`` command line switch can be included which will print
the prompt and command to the output:

.. code-block:: text

  $ echo list | tomcat-manager --echo localhost
  --connected to https://home.kotfu.net/manager as ace
  tomcat-manager> list
  Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
  ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
  /                        running        0 ROOT
  /manager                 running        0 manager

For most common errors, like failed authorization, connection timeouts, and DNS
lookup failures, ``tomcat-manager`` catches the exceptions raised by those
errors, and outputs a terse message describing the problem. For example, if my
Tomcat container is not currently running, or if the HTTP request fails for any
other reason, you will see something like this:

.. code-block:: text

  $ tm vm list
  connection error

If you want all the gory detail, give the ``--debug`` command line switch or
set ``debug=True``. Then you'll see something like this (stack trace truncated
with '...'):

.. code-block:: text

  $ tm --debug vm list
