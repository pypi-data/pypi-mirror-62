Description: ## Glitch This!
        A commandline tool + `python` library to glitchify images and **even make GIFs** out of them!
        Featuring *10 different levels of glitching intensity*! The algorithm used to create glitched images is a slightly modifed version of the popular [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/) tool's algorithm, so you can expect the glitched images to look really cool!
        
        **NOW EASIER THAN EVER TO USE! Check out the [docs](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/wiki/Home)!**
        
        If you like using this tool, please consider **starring on Github**!

        What are you waiting for? Import the library and get glitching!
        
        **NOTE** : Works best with RGB/RGBA images

        View the changelog [here](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
        
        ## FEATURES!
        * Choose from *10 gradually different levels* of **glitching intensity**!
          Want just a tiny bit of glitching, enough to make your image look cool? - use level 2 (my favorite)!
        * Create **Glitched GIFs** from a normal image!
          That's right, before this tool, I had to manually download each image from [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/), save them, and then head to a GIF creation website.
          Now you can do it *all* at once!
        * Customize the **number of frames** in a GIF as well as their **duration** - all from the comfort of your terminal!
        * Add **scan lines** for a retro CRT effect!
        * Oh and did I mention, **color offset**? Just like [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/), this tool *glitches the color channels* as well as the pixels - for **very convincing** looking glitched images!
        
        ## Requirements
        * `python 3`
        * `pillow`
        * `numpy`
        
        These will be automatically installed when you install the library! (assuming you have `python3`)

        ## Whoa! Cool Glitches
        Here's some glitched images generated from this script - of different intensity levels!
        
        **NOTE**: All these images had `-c` parameter included, for color offset
        
        #### Original image for reference:-

        *I don't know what I'm looking at*
        
        Let's get some **scan lines** on there!
        
        #### Glitched version (scan_lines)- Level 2:-
        
        ![glitched_2_scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/master/example/glitched2scan.png)

        That's neat, but how about some GIFs? Here's some GIFs from the same image:-
        
        *Note: All the GIFs use default values from `FRAMES` and `DURATION`, i.e 23 and 200 respectively*
