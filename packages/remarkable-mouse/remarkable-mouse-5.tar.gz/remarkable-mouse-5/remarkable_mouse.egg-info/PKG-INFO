        # Usage
        
        ``` bash
        pip install remarkable-mouse
        remouse
        ```
        
        By default, `10.11.99.1` is used as the address.  Seems to work pretty well wirelessly, too.
        
        # Examples
        
        ``` bash
        # specify address, monitor, orientation, password
        remouse --address 192.168.1.1 --orientation right --monitor 1 --password foobar
        
        # pubkey login
        ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/remarkable -N ''
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/remarkable.pub root@10.11.99.1
        remouse --key ~/.ssh/remarkable
        ```
