# Bookify
> Transform pdf files into books for double-sided printing

## Preparing the book: Layout
1. Use Calibre to convert the book to .docx format
2. Modify the resulting docx, applying the following changes:
	- Add title page + empty page (usually the second page is empty)
	- Maybe add extra pages such as index or dedication
	- Add page numbering (make sure to make it start only after the special pages such as index/dedication)
	- Make sure that every new chaper is in an odd page (this is to make it so that the first page of every chaper appears on the left)
	- Make the total number of pages a multiple of 4 (if it's not, empty pages will be added at the end to pad it)
	- It's recommended to set the size of the document to A5 and use generous margins
3. Export the document into a pdf (we will refer to this pdf as `formatted.pdf`)

**Note**: You can use [this docx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corollari/bookify/master/book.docx) as a template and/or example of the book layout described.
