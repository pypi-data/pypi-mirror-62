`sparql-client` is a library to query a SPARQL endpoint. It will automatically
convert literals to the coresponding Python types.

Visit http://www.eionet.europa.eu/software/sparql-client/ for documentation and
examples.


API
---

First you open a connection to the endpoint::

    s = sparql.Service(endpoint, "utf-8", "GET")

Then you make the query::

    result = s.query(statement)

If you have made a SELECT query, then you can read the result with fetchone() or fetchall()::

    for row in result.fetchone():

If you have made an ASK query, then you can read the result (a boolean value) with hasresult():

    works = result.hasresult()


Conversion of data types
------------------------

The library will automatically convert typed literals to a coresponding
simple type in Python. Dates are also converted if the dateutil_ library is
available.

Running the unit tests
----------------------

If you have nose_ installed, just run ``nosetests`` in the top-level directory.
Some tests require the python-dateutil_ (version 1.5) or mock_ libraries.
Tested under Python 2.4 through 2.7.
