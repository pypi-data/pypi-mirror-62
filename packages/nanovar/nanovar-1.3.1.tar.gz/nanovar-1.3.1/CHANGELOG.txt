Version 1.3.0 - Feb 28, 2020
    * Tool requirement changes:
        * Added SAMTools
        * Added Minimap2

    * Algorithm and pipeline changes:
        * NanoVar now uses both minimap2 and hs-blastn for increased sensitivity

        * Added progress information command-line feed during the run.

    * Input/Ouput changes:
        * NanoVar can now take a BAM file (tested BAM from minimap2) as input instead of FASTQ/FASTA reads

        * Added SAMTools executable path option

    * VCF format changes:
        * "END" coordinate for BND SVs will now show POS+1 coordinate instead of "." to be usable for IGV (Thanks to Scott)
