        =================
        
        **[WIP] This codebase is a work in progress!** We plan to release the first version in the near future. In the meantime, we can't rule out bugs and API instabilities.
        
        A package for working with single-neuron morphological reconstruction data, such as those in the [Allen Cell Types Database](https://celltypes.brain-map.org/). Provides tools for processing, visualizing, and analyzing such reconstructions.
        
        For usage and installation instructions, see the [documentation](neuron_morphology.rtfd.io).
