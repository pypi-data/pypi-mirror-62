Description: # About
        
        kloudy is a python package which provides a human-friendly command-line interface for your cloud (AWS, GCP & Azure) 
        provider resources. At the moment, it supports AWS and Google cloud however the support for Azure will be added soon.
        
        kloudy is not a replacement to any command-line interface/SDK provided by AWS or GCP.kloudy does not aim to replace 
        any command-line utility provided by cloud provider but it aims to help cloud user/administrator do his/her routine 
        tasks much more easily.
        
        # Features
        
        *   Unified command-line interface to multiple cloud providers (AWS and GCP for now)
        *   Gets you data across all regions/projects easily
        *   Works seamlessly with your existing AWS/GCP configuration files and environment variables.
        
        # Known Limitations
        
        *   still in an alpha stage
        *   runs only on python 3.6 and above
        
        # Installation
        
        The easiest way to install kloudy is to use pip in a virtualenv:
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        pip install kloudy
        ```
        
        or, if you are not installing in a virtualenv, to install globally:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install kloudy
        ```
        
        or for your user:
        
        ```bash
        pip install kloudy --user
        ```
        
        # Getting Started - AWS
        
        Before using kloudy, you need to provide it with your AWS credentials. You can do this in several ways:
        
        *   Environment variables
            * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Specifies the secret key associated with the access key. This is essentially the "password" for the access key.
            * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Specifies an AWS access key associated with an IAM user or role.
            * AWS_DEFAULT_REGION - Specifies the AWS Region to send the request to.
            
            For example,
            ```bash
            $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
            $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
            $ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
            ```
            More details available at,
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html
            
        *   Shared credentials file
            * AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE - Specifies the location of the file that the AWS CLI uses to store access keys. The default path is ~/.aws/credentials).
        
        *   Config file
            * AWS_CONFIG_FILE - Specifies the location of the file that the AWS CLI uses to store configuration profiles. The default path is ~/.aws/config).
        
        *   IAM Role
            * You can configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to use an IAM role by defining a profile for the role in the ~/.aws/config file.
            
            For example,
            
            ```bash
            [profile marketingadmin]
            role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole
            source_profile = user1
            ```
            More details available at,
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html
            
        The quickest way to get started is to run the aws configure command:
        
        ```bash
        $ aws configure
        AWS Access Key ID: foo
        AWS Secret Access Key: bar
        Default region name [us-west-2]: eu-west-1
        Default output format [None]: json
        ```
        # Usage
        
        *   Load your AWS credentials into an environment
        *   Run kloudy command with an appropriate option
