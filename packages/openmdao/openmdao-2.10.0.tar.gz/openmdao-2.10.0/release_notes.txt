Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.10.0

February 25, 2020

Note: This is the last release of OpenMDAO 2.X. Updating to this release will be a 
critical step in preparing for the OpenMDAO 3.X releases


Backwards Incompatible API Changes: 
-----------------------------------

- <POEM 004> AkimaSplineComp and BsplineComp have been deprecated, replaced with SplineComp

- <POEM 008>
  - The user is now required to set a value for the solver option `solve_subsystems` 
    on Newton and Broyden solvers. Previously the default was `False`, but you will now get 
    a deprecation warning if this value is not explicitly set. 

- Specification of `includes` and `excludes` for solver case recording options 
  has been changed to use promoted names relative to the location of that solver in the model. 

Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes: 
----------------------------------------
Note: These changes are not technically API related, but 
still may cause your results to differ when upgrading. 

- <POEM 012> The old implementation of KrigingSurrogate was hard coded to the 
  `gesdd` method for inverses. The method is now an option, but we've changed 
  the default to `gesvd` because its more numerically stable. 
  This might introduce slight numerical changes to the Kriging fits. 

- Refactor of how reverse mode derivative solves work for parallel components 
  that may require the removal of reduce calls in some components that were 
  needed previously 

- Change to the way SimpleGA does crossover to be more correct (was basically just mutuation before)


New Features: 
-------------

- <POEM 001> astronomical unit (au) and parsec (pc) added to the standard unit definitions. 

- <POEM 002> users can now manually terminate an optimization using operating system signals 

- <POEM 003> 
  - users can now add I/O, connections, and promotions in configure 
  - new API method added to groups to allow promotions after a subsystem has already been added

- <POEM 004> SplineComp was added to the standard component library, 
  and you can also import the interpolation algorithms to use in your own components

- <POEM 005> OpenMDAO plugin system has been defined, so users can now publish their own plugins on github. 
  several utilities added to openmdao command line tools related to plugins

- <POEM 007> ExternalCodeComp and ExternalCodeImplicitComp can now accept strings 
  (previously a lists of strings was required) for `command`, `command_apply`, and `command_solve`. 

- <POEM 010> User can now mark some options as `recordable=False` as an alternative to 
  using `system.recording_options['options_exclude']`

- <POEM 012> KrigingSurrogate now has a new option `lapack_driver` to determine how an inverse is computed
  The original implementation used a default `gesdd` method, but we've changed to `gesvd`.

- Slight improvements to the metamodel viewer output

- Improvement to the bidirectional Jacobian coloring so it will fall back to 
  pure forward or reverse if thats faster

- Users can now set the shape for outputs of `BalanceComp` and `EqConstraintsComp`

- Improvements to `debug_print` for driver related to reporting which derivatives 
  are being computed when coloring is active

- The N2 viewer now works for models that are run in parallel (i.e. if you're using mpi to call python)

- `list_inputs` and `list_outputs` both have arguments for including local_size and 
  global_size of distributed outputs in their reports


Bug Fixes: 
----------
- Fixed a hang in SimpleGA driver related to mpi calls 
- Fixed a bug in SimpleGA related to setting a vector of constraints
- Various bug-fixes to allow running with Python 3.8
- Fixed a bug in ScipyOptimizer/Cobyla related to objective and dv scaling
- Corrected bug preventing the user from passing a list to `set_val` when the variable is an array

Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.1

October 8, 2019

2.9.1 is a quick patch release to correct a couple of issues:

Bug Fixes: 
----------
- The previous release inadvertantly changed the default "bounds_enforce" option on the BoundsEnforce
  line search to "vector".  This release restores the default to the originally intended "scalar".
- The entry point for the `web_view` utility function was fixed. (Thank you Nicholas Bollweg)
- Fixed a bug that prevented model reconfigurability in certain situations.
- Fixed a missing `sqrt` in the documentation for the Hohmann example.
- Fixed a bug that prevented proper fallback from bidirectional coloring to unidirectional coloring
  in certain cases where the bidirectional coloring was worse than the unidirectional coloring.

New Features: 
-------------
- Small improvements were made to the MetaModel viewer, along with some additional testing.


################################################################################################
Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.0

October 1, 2019

New Features: 
-------------

- better detection of when you're running under MPI, and new environment variable to forcibly disable MPI
- users can now issue connections from within the `configure` method on group 
  (this is useful if you wanted to be able to interrogate your children before issuing connections)
- significant overhead reduction due to switching from 'np.add.at' to 'np.bincount' for some matrix-vector
  products and data transfers.

- `openmdao` command line tool: 
    - new `openmdao scaffold` command line tool to quickly bootstrap component and group files
    - `openmdao summary` command gives more data including number of constraints
    - `openmdao tree` command now uses different colors for implicit and explicit components and 
      includes sizes of inputs and outputs
    - the `openmdao --help` tool gives better formatted help now

- CaseRecording: 
    - Case objects now have a `name` attribute to make identifying them simpler
    - Case objects now support __getitem__ (i.e. <case>[<some_var>]) and the
      get_val/set_val methods to directly mimic the problem interface
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on Case objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns     

- Documentation:    
    - added documentation for the list_inputs and list_outputs method on the Case object
    - added example use of implicit component for add_discrete_input docs
    - some minor cleanup to the cantilever beam optimization example to remove some unused code

- Derivatives: 
    - slightly different method of computing the total derivative sparsity pattern has been implemented
      that should be a bit more robust (but YMMV)
    - the partials object passed into `linearize` and `compute_partials` methods on implicit
      and explicit component respectively can now be iterated on like a true dictionary

- Solvers: 
    - a true Goldstein condition was added to the ArmijoGoldstein line search 
      (you can now choose if you want Armijo or Goldstein) *** Peter Onodi ***
    - DirectSolver now works under MPI 
      (but be warned that it might be very slow to use it this way, because it does a lot of MPI communication!!!)
    - BroydenSolver now works in parallel
    - improved error message when you have a nonconverged solver 
    - improved error message when solver failure is due to Nan or Inf

- Components: 
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on System objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns
    - variables can now have tags added as additional meta-data when they are declared,
      which can then be used to filter the output from list_inputs and list_ouputs 
    - significant speed improvements and increased surrogate options for StructuredMetaModel
    - improved error message when required options are not provided to a component during instantiation
    - user gets a clear error msg if they try to use `np.` or `numpy.` namespaces inside ExecComp strings
    - in the declare_coloring method, a threshold can now be set such that the generated coloring must improve
      things at least as much as the given percentage or the coloring will not be used. This can happen in cases
      where multiple instances of the same component class appear in a given model and each instance can potentially
      generate a different sparsity which results in a different coloring.

- Problem
    - user can set specific slices of variables using the set_val method on problem
    - added problem.compute_jacvec_prod function for matrix-free total derivative products. 
      Useful for wrapping for loops around an OpenMDAO problem and propagating derivatives through it.

- Visualization
    - minor reformatting of the N2 menu to make better use of vertical screen space
    - new visualziation tool for examining the surrogates in StructuredMetaModelComp and UnstructuredMetaModelComp
    - improved `openmdao view_connections` functionality for better filtering and toggling between 
      promoted and absolute names
    - component names can now optionally be shown on the diagonal for XDSM diagrams *** Peter Onodi ***

Backwards Incompatible API Changes: 
-----------------------------------
- `openmdao view_model` has been deprecated, use `openmdao n2` instead
- `vectorize` argument to ExecComp has been deprecated, use `has_diag_partials` instead

New Features:
-------------
- MetaModelStructured will detect NaN in requested sample and print a readable message.
- ScipyOptimizeDriver now supports Hessian calculation option for optimizers that use it.
- User can specify src_indices that have duplicates or have two inputs on a single component connected to the same output, and still have CSC Jacobian work.
- User can get/set problem values in a straightforward manner: prob['var'] = 2., etc. even when running in parallel.
    - Problem 'get' access to distributed variables will raise an exception since it isn't clear what behavior is expected,
      i.e. should prob['comp.x'] return the full distributed variable or just the local part.
- Directsolver has an improved error message when it detects identical rows or columns in Jacobian.
- The NonlinearBlockGS solver has been updated with a less expensive implementation that does not call the compute method of Explicit components as many times.
- User can request a directional-derivative check (similar to SNOPTs built-in level 0 check) for check_partials.

-----------------------------------
- The default bounds enforcement for BoundsEnforceLS is now 'scalar' (was 'vector')
- Direct solver will now use 'assemble_jac=True' by default
- Recording options 'includes' and 'excludes' now use promoted names for outputs (absolute path names are still used for inputs)
- FloatKrigingSurrogate has been deprecated since it does not provide any unique functionality.
- FloatMultifiKrigingSurrogate has been deleted because it was never used, was incorrectly implemented, and provides no new functionality.

Bug Fixes:
----------
- Complex-step around Newton+DirectSolver now works with assembled Jacobians.
- Armijolinesearch implementation was incorrect when used with solve_subsystems. The implementation is now correct.

################################################################################################
Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.5.0

October 31, 2018

New Features:
--------------
- list_outputs() method now includes a `prom_name` argument to include the promoted name in the printed output (Thanks John Jasa!).
- N2 viewer now includes tool tip (hover over) showing the promoted name of any variable.
- Improved error msg when building sparse partials with duplicate col/row entries.
- You can now build the docs without MPI/PETSc installed (you will get warnings, but no longer errors).
- Major internal refactor to reduce overhead on compute_totals calls (very noticeable on large design spaces but still cheap problems).
- Components now have a `under_complex_step` attribute you can check to see if complex-step is currently active.
- Components `distributed` attribute has been moved to an option (old attribute has been deprecated).
- MetaModelUnstructured will now use FD for partial derivatives of surrogates that don't provide analytic derivatives (user can override the default settings if they wish to use CS or different FD config).
- Improvements to SimpleGA to make it more stable, and added support constraints via penalty functions (Thanks madsmpedersen and onodip).
- Parallel FD and CS at the component and group level is now supported.
- Can turn off the analytic derivative sub-system if it is not needed via an argument to setup().
- Derivative coloring now works for problems that run under MPI.

- New Components in the standard library:
    - Mux and Demux components.

- New CaseRecording/CaseReading Features:
    - DesVar AND output variable bounds are both reordered now.
    - Improved error msg if you try to load a non-existent file with CaseReader.

- **Experimental Feature**: Discrete data passing is now supported as an experimental feature... we're still testing it, and may change the API!

Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
------------------------------------
- `get_objectives` method on CaseReader now returns a dict-like object.
- Output vector is now locked (read-only) when inside the `apply_nonlinear` method (you shouldn't have been changing it then anyway!).
- default step size for complex-step has been changed to 1e-40.
- Moderate refactor of the CaseReader API. It is now self-consistent.

################################################################################################

    - Updated the Case recording format for better performance.
    - User can call <Problem>.record_iteration() to save specific cases.
      Recording options for this method are separate from driver/solver options.
      This is so you can record one (or more) cases manually with *ALL* the variables in it if you want to.

Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
------------------------------------
- The input and output vectors are now put into read-only modes within certain component methods.
  NOTE: This REALLY REALLY should not break anyone's models, but it is technically a backwards-incompatible change...
        If you were changing values in these arrays when you shouldn't have been, you're going to get an error now.
        Fix it... the new error is enforcing correct behavior.
        If it was working before, you got lucky.

Bug Fixes:
------------
- Various small bug fixes to check_partials and check_totals.
- ArmijoGoldstein linesearch iteration counter works correctly now.
- the record_derivatives recorder_option now actually does something!

   (the mult input isn't used most of the time)
- Renamed `MetaModel` to `UnstructuredMetaModel` and `MultiFiMetaModel` to `UnStructuredMultiFiMetaModel`


Backwards Incompatible API changes:
-----------------------------------
- Case Recording options API updated with `.recording_options` attribute on Driver, Solver, and System classes
- `get_subsystem` changed to a private method, removed from public API of System
- `check_partials` now has a `method` argument that controls which type of check

Bug Fixes:
-----------
- Improved error msg on a corner case for when user doesn't declare a partial derivative
- Fixed docs embedding bug when `<>` included in the output text
