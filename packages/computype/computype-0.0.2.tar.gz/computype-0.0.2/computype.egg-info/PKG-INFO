Description: This library allows you to do things like: make it look like your computer is typing(ctype), backspace text(backspace), clear the screen(clear), and wait for the user to press enter(pressenter). 
        
        ***ctype***
        
        To use ctype, do ctype(text, speed). Replace text with what you want to type and speed with the amount of time between each letter.
        
        ***backspace***
        
        Backspace works the same as ctype. backspace(text, speed).
        
        ***pressenter***
        
        All you have to do is type pressenter(). It waits for you to press enter!
        
        ***clear***
        
        Just type clear() to clear the screen. Works on any system that's NT (Windows, DOS) or UNIX (macOS, Linux, Solaris, and almost every other OS) compatible.
