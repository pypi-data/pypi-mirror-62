Description: # PyNWJS
        
        PyNWJS is a pair of frameworks in Python and JavaScript to integrate the powerful GUI framework NWJS in Python programs.
        In particular, it allows you to run a regular NWJS application as the GUI of a Python program
        and establish an event-based communication between the two.
        Both sides can register event callbacks on arbitrary custom events and emit such events,
        e.g., to notify about button presses or results of extended computations.

        PyNWJS does not have any dependencies itself, but expects either your application or the user system to provide the desired [NWJS](https://nwjs.io) executable.
