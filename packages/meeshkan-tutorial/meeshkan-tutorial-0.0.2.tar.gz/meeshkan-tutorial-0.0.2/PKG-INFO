        An interactive tutorial for getting started with [Meeshkan](#what-is-meeshkan).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install meeshkan-tutorial
        ```
        
        This tutorial has been tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
        
        ## Running
        
        After installing, you can begin the tutorial by invoking from the command line:
        
        ```bash
        $ meeshkan-tutorial
        ```
        
        Once you've run this, you should see:
        
        ```bash
                                     __    __

        ## What to expect
        
        By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to use Meeshkan to:
        - Record server traffic from an API
        - Transform those recordings into an OpenAPI spec
        - Create a mock server from the spec
        
        You'll repeat this two times: once to build a mock server that serves back recordings (similar to [wiremock](https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock) or [hoverfly](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly)), and once to build a mock server that serves back synthetic data (similar to [unmock](https://github.com/meeshkan/unmock-js) or [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check)).  The tutorial will end by showing how these two modes can be mixed.
        
        ## What is Meeshkan
        
        [Meeshkan](https://github.com/meeshkan/meeshkan) is a tool for mocking HTTP APIs for use in sandboxes as well as for automated and exploratory testing. It uses a combination of API definitions, recorded traffic and code in order to make crafting mocks as enjoyable as possible.
