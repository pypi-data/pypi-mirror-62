Box Definition
-----------------

The *BOX* mentioned above is a specification of horizontal and
vertical size. The syntax is as follows (with multiplier being
specified optionally):

  *box* = [ *multiplier* ] *unit*

  *multiplier* = *number* "x" *number*

  *unit* = *medianame* or *distancename*

Many international media names are recognised by the program, in upper
and lower case, and can be shortened to their first few characters, as
long as unique. For instance 'A0', 'Let'. Distance names are like
'cm', 'inch', 'ft'.

Medias are typically not quadratic but rectangular, which means width
and height differ. Thus using media names is a bit tricky:

:10x20cm: obvious: 10 cm x 20 cm (portrait)
:20x10cm: same as 10x20cm, since all boxes are rotated to portrait
          format

Now when using media names it gets tricky:

:1x1a4: same as approx. 21x29cm (21 cm x 29 cm, portrait)
:1x2a4: same as approx. 21x58cm (21 cm x 58 cm, portrait)

        This are two a4 pages put together at the *small* side: One
        portrait page wide and two portrait pages high.

:2x1a4: same as approx. 42x29cm, which is rotated to portrait and is
        (approx.) the same as 29x42cm (29 cm x 42 cm)

        This are two a4 pages put together at the *long* side: Two
        portrait pages wide and one portrait page high.
