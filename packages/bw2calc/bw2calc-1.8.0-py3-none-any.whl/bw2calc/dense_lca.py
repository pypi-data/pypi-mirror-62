    To most numerical analysts, matrix inversion is a sin.

We use `UMFpack <http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/>`_, which is a very fast solver for sparse matrices.

If the technosphere matrix has already been factorized, then the decomposed technosphere (``self.solver``) is reused. Otherwise the calculation is redone completely.
