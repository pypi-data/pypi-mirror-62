        yotta is a tool that we're building at `mbed <https://mbed.org>`_ to make it
        easier to build better software written in C, C++ or other C-family languages.
        It's still early in development, so if you have questions/feedback or issues, please `report them on Github <https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta/issues>`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        While yotta is written in python, to use it to build software you'll need several non-python dependencies. Detailed installation instructions and links to installers can be found on the `yotta docs site <http://docs.yottabuild.org>`_.
        
        Get Started
        ===========
        The best way to get started is to `follow the tutorial <http://docs.yottabuild.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>`_.
