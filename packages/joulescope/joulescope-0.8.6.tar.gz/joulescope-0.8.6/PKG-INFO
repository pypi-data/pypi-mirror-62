        Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an affordable, precision DC energy 
        analyzer that enables you to build better products. 
        Joulescope accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
        supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
        For more information on Joulescope, see 
        [www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).
        
        This pyjoulescope python package contains the driver and command-line 
        utilities that  run on a host computer and communicates with a Joulescope 
        device over USB. You can use this package to automate and script Joulescope 
        operation. You can also incorporate Joulescope into a custom application.
        Most users will run the graphical user interface which is in the 
        [pyjoulescope_ui](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui) package. 
        The majority of code is written in Python 3.6+, but a small amount is in 
        Cython for better performance. 
        
        This package runs under Windows 10, Linux (Ubuntu is tested) and Mac OS X.
        On Windows, the USB communication is performed using 
        [WinUSB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/winusb),
        which is included with Windows 10.
        On Linux and Mac OS X, the USB communication uses 
        [libusb-1.0](https://libusb.info/).
        
        For the list of changes by release, see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
        
        If you just want to use Joulescope, you can 
        [download](https://www.joulescope.com/download) the application.
        
        
        ## Quick start
        
        Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ 64-bit.  If you already have
        Python installed, verify 3.6+ and 64-bit:
        
            python3 -VV
        
        Install this python package from pypi:
        
            pip3 install joulescope
        
        The Joulescope python package includes command line tools:
        
            python3 -m joulescope --help
            
        For example, to capture 1 second of contiguous data:
        
            python3 -m joulescope capture --contiguous 1.0 mycapture.jls
            
        You can also import the Joulescope python package in your own programs.
        For example, this script opens the joulescope instrument, reads 1/4 second 
        of data, and then display the averaged values:
        
            import joulescope
            import numpy as np
        
            js = joulescope.scan_require_one()
            js.open()
            try:
                js.parameter_set('source', 'on')
                js.parameter_set('i_range', 'auto')
                data = js.read(contiguous_duration=0.25)
            finally:
                js.close()
        
            current, voltage = np.mean(data, axis=0)
            print(f'{current} A, {voltage} V')
        
        For more examples, see 
        [pyjoulescope_examples](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_examples)
        
        ## Developer
        
        Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ 64-bit. 
        
        
        ### Configure virtualenv
        
        Although not required, the developers recommend using 
        [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
        
        First install virtualenv:
        
            pip3 install virtualenv
            
        And then create a new virtual environment.
        
            virtualenv ~/venv/joulescope
        
        You need to activate the virtual environment whenever you start
        a new terminal.
            
        On POSIX (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):
        
            source ~/venv/joulescope/bin/activate
            
        On Windows:
        
            virtualenv c:\venv\joulescope
            source c:\venv\joulescope\Scripts\activate
        
        ### Configure packages
            
        Install development dependencies:
        
            pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        
        
        ### Use Joulescope
            
        Joulescope includes PYX files that must be compiled to native libraries using
        Cython. You can use the setup script to allow development in place:
        
            python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
            
        You should then be able to execute joulescope:
        
            python3 -m joulescope --help
        
        If you want to switch directories, you may need to set your 
        [PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH)
        environment variable.
        
        If you would rather build and install Joulescope:
        
            python setup.py sdist
            pip3 install dist/joulescope_[version].tar.gz
