        =========
        
        Control Spotify Connect devices using MPRIS2
        
        ****
        
        This software provides an MPRIS2 interface for Spotify Connect. It is more complete than the MPRIS2 interface built into the Spotify Linux client.  
        In addition it can be used to control remote Spotify Connect devices (Like spotifyd running on a Raspberry Pi) from your PC.
        
        This software is still in development. Some things might not work as expected.

        Known problems
        --------------
        1. **Podcasts, Radios, etc. aren't supported.**  
            This is a limitation of the Spotify Web API. There's currently nothing I can do about it.
