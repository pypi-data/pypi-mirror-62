### Simple Python Jupyter Turtle library 

This library contains simple turtle library suitable for Jupyter Notebooks. Unlike other similar 
libraries that require installation of Jupyter Notebook extensions to enable real-time drawing, this
one relies purely on `matplotlib` functionality to do the drawing. Thus, it does not support real-time
drawing, but instead it contains a feature to show step-by-step drawing process as a series of plots.
