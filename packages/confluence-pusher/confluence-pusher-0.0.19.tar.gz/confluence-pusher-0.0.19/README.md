# confluence-pusher

A tool to convert and upload markdown documents into Atlassian Confluence using [Atlassian Python API](https://atlassian-python-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## How it works

### The flow

### File conversion

**Please note that Confluence can't create two documents with the same name in the same space, for example: folder /Build and file named build.md**

It looks over the folder defined in SOURCE_FOLDER parameter in **config.json** and then traversing it looking for markdown files. The folder and document structure are being replicated in Confluence as follows with the document conversion being performed by Pandoc using [this](https://github.com/jpbarrette/pandoc-confluence-writer/blob/master/confluence.lua) custom filter:

| Local filesystem | Action                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SOURCE_FOLDER:   | Root document as defined by SOURCE_FOLDER parameter in **config.json**                                                                       |
| - file01.md      | Markdown file to be converted into nesting document under SOURCE_FOLDER name                                                                 |
| - file02.md      | The markdown headers are being read during the conversion. If not available, file02 is going to be used with markdown file extension dropped |
| - README.md      | Will be converted in root document content                                                                                                   |
| - directory01:   | Section document                                                                                                                             |
| -- file03.md     | Markdown file to be converted into nesting document under directory01 name with the same rules as above                                      |
| -- README.md     | Will be converted in section content. The section document is to be renamed with markdown header if available                                |

## Install

### Install from PyPi:

```bash
pip install confluence-pusher
```

### Install and run from the source code - Mac OS X

Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

## Configure

Get your wiki link and space name:

![Confluence link example](./img/configuration.svg)

### Update following parameters in **config.json**

```json
{
    "CONFLUENCE_SPACE": "",
    "CONFLUENCE_PARENT_PAGE": "", // leaving this blank will put document root page directly into Confluence space listed above
    "CONFLUENCE_URL": "https://domain.atlassian.net",
    "CONFLUENCE_USERID": "your.email@domain.com",
    "DELETE_ROOT_DOCUMENT_ON_STARTUP": true
}
```

## Run

Once you configured your credentials in credentials.sh simply run:

```bash
python3 cfpusher.py -s ../dir -t oauthtoken
```

where **../dir** is your folder with markdown files and **oauthtoken** is [Confluence API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens).
