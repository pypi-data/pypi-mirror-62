        ## Running a strategy
        
        Our main concern is to implement and maintain strategies in a robust way. We do not rewrite our codes for production servers 
        in alternative programming languages. We use the same Python scripts both in research and production. 
        
        A strategy is a script loading time series data from an archive and using parameters specified a priori.
        For research it is helpful to interfere with the parameters before the strategy iterates in a backtest through history.
