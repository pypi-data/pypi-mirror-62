passpy has been created to be fully compatible with ZX2C4's pass
(htpps://passwordstore.org).  Therefore the code is at times a direct
port of pass's implementation.  Especially user shown strings like
error messages and function explanations have mostly been directly
copied over, with only small alterations.

The .gitignore file is taken from another project, hat can be found at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore
and licensed under the MIT licence.

The copy_move function in passpy.util is partially based on the cp
function from the pycoreutils package
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycoreutils) written by Hans van Leeuwen
and licensed under the MIT licence.

The _gen_tree function in passpy.__main__ is taken from the docktree
package (https://github.com/cmihai/docktree) written by Mihai CiumeicÄƒ
and licensed under the MIT licence.
