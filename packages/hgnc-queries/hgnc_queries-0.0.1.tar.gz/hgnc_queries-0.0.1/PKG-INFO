Description: # hgnc_queries.py 
        
        Query HGNC for gene symbols.  
        Created to attempt to rescue old gene symbols because of an old excel "database" that had to be converted in a Django database
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install hgnc_queries
        ```
        
        ## Examples:
        
        Use HGNC api to get:
        ```
        # Get new symbol
        python hgnc_queries.py new_symbol $gene
        
        # Get aliases of given symbol
        python hgnc_queries.py alias $gene
        
        # Get main symbol of alias
        python hgnc_queries.py main_symbol $gene
        
        # Get previous symbol
        python hgnc_queries.py prev_symbol $gene
        
        # Get genes starting with
        python hgnc_queries.py gene $gene
        
        # Get HGNC id of given symbol
        python hgnc_queries.py id $gene
        
        # Get symbol of given id
        python hgnc_queries.py id2symbol $gene_id
        ```
