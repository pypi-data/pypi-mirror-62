# About

`cbitstruct` is a C implementation of the `bitstruct` library. Credits to Erik Moqvist for the original `bitstruct` library available on [Github](https://github.com/eerimoq/bitstruct) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/bitstruct/).

The goal is to provide the same API an idealy to be able to interchange `import bitstruct` and `import cbitstruct as bitstruct`.

Obvious increased performance comes with limitations described below.

# Installation

```bash
pip3 install cbitstruct
```

# Documentation

Please refer to the [`bitstruct` documentation](https://bitstruct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the aim of this library is to provide the same API with increased performance.

If you are not used to `bitstruct`, you should seriously consider using it first, before migrating to this library if you require higher performance.

# Limitations

| Limitation | Will it be lifted ? |
|------------|---------------------|
| All types except padding are limited to 64 bits | Maybe for 'raw' and 'text' types |
| May not work on big-endian architectures | Maybe |
| Exceptions differ from `bitstruct` | Probably not |
| CPython only | Probably not |
| Error messages are unclear | Will never be as clear as `bitstruct` |
| Python >= 3.5 | No |

Some limitations are there because I did not get the time or motivation to lift them up. Some other are deeply rooted into this library and may never be lifted.

# Performance

## Comparing to `bitstruct`

The script available in `tests/test_perf.py` measures performance comparing to the `bitstruct` library.

Here are the result "on my machine" (Ubuntu in Virtualbox on a laptop):
```
byteswap list of int      | x  8.779 (   8.638us ->   0.984us)

unpack_from_dict          | x 39.467 (  88.043us ->   2.231us)
```

*Disclaimer:* these results may and will vary largely depending on the number of elements and types you pack/unpack. This script is provided as-is, and I will gladly accept an improved script providing more reliable results.


## The dict API
The `dict` API is marginally slower than the traditional one. As the packing/unpacking performance is quite high, the overhead of performing dictionary lookups and hashing significantly increas pack and unpacking duration.
