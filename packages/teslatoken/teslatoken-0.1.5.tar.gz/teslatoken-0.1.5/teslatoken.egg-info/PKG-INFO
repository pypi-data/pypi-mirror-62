        Description
        ===========
        
        *teslatoken* is a tool for creating authorization tokens for Tesla Model S/X cars. This is useful to give access for 3rd party applications without giving away your username and password.
        
        The tool is intended to use as a stand alone tool rather than including the module in other python modules.
