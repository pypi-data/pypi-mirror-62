Description: Current state: **alpha**, yet API seems fine and mostly stable.
        
        Since version 0.6.0 peewee-async is compatible with peewee 3.5+ and
        support of Python 3.4 is dropped.
        
        * Works on Python 3.5+
        * Required peewee 3.5+
        * Has support for PostgreSQL via `aiopg`
        * Has support for MySQL via `aiomysql`
        * Single point for high-level async API
        * Drop-in replacement for sync code, sync will remain sync
        * Basic operations are supported
        * Transactions support is present, yet not heavily tested
        
        The source code is hosted on `GitHub`_.
