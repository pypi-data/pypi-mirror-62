Description: # network_extensions
        
        
        A collections of tools to handle networks changing in time as well as different types of multilayer networks.
        The project is still only beta. 
        
        I am working on a improved documentation. See the progress at:
        
        
        https://readthedocs.org/projects/network-extension/
        
        If you install it via pypi:
        
            pip install network-extensions
        
        there might be missing dependencies. Not all requirements are added to the setup.py file, yet.
