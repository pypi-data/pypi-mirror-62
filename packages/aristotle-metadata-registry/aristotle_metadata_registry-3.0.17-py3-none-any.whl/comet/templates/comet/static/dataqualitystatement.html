{% block description %}
    <p> A statement of data quality issued to support an indicator or data source. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has issued seven dimensions by which data quality can be assessed: Institutional Environment, Relevance, Timeliness, Accuracy, Coherence, Interpretability and Accessibility.</P>
    
    <P> The ABS describes these dimensions as follows:
    1. Institutional Environment - Information on the institutional environment within which the data are collected and processed. This includes such information as legislative obligations, financing and governance, and the transparency of the operations. 
    2. Relevance - Information that will allow you to determine whether the data presented is relevant for your particular need. Because different users will have different uses for the data, providing information about the collected data will help you make an informed decision as to its fitness for your particular purpose.
    3. Timeliness - Information that will help you to determine if the data is current enough for your purpose, or if it relates to the period of interest. This is done through imparting information about the reference period of the collection, and the date on which information becomes available.
    4. Accuracy - Information about how precisely the statistics measure the true quantities of interest. Accuracy can vary greatly across collections and across data items within the same collection. It is important to assess the dimension and make a decision as to whether the information contained affects your needs.
    5. Coherence - Information about the comparability of the information with other key related statistics, and changes in this collection over time. 
    6.Interpretability - Information on where to find more information about the collection to help you understand it better. 
    7. Accessibility - Information on the ease of finding and acquiring data. </P>
