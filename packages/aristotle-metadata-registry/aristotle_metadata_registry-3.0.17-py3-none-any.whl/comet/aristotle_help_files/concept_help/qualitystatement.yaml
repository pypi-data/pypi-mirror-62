            <p>
            The ABS Data Quality Framework (ABS DQF) provides the standards for assessing and reporting on the quality of statistical information.
            It can also assist you with the development of statistical collections to produce high quality outputs.
            </p><p>
            The ABS DQF is based on the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-586-x/12-586-x2002001-eng.pdf">
            Statistics Canada Quality Assurance Framework (PDF, 178.05 KB)</a> and the

            It consists of seven dimensions of quality: institutional environment, relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence, interpretability, and accessibility.
