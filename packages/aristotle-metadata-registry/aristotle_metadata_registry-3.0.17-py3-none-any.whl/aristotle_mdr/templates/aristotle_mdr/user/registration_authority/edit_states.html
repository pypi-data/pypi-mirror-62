        On this page you can also describe the meaning for each registration state for this Registration Authority.

        <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Changing the Locked state or Public state
        for a Registration Authority only changes the publication of content
        created or updated after this settings is changed.
        </p><p>
        Changing theses states <em>does not</em> change 
        the publication of metadata already published within the registy.
        </p><p>
        To update the publication of existing metadata when changing these levels,
        contact the registry administrators.
