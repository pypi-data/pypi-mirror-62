The actual units in which the associated values are measured.

{% block definition %}

<P>The units in which the values in a value domain are measured. Adding unit of measure information makes the value more 
meaningful, especially in instances where a concept can be measured using various units of measure. For example, length or distance may be measured in millimetres, centimetres, inches, metres, feet, kilometres or miles etc.</P>

<P>While units of measure are specifically related to value domains, they are impertive to the formation of well described 
data elements.</P>
