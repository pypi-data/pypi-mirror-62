    brief: A Value Domain describes how to record the measurement of a particular type of data,
        either using a coded list of values or a description of the possible values.
        Value Domains can be linked to [[Data Element|s]] that all share a common way of recording
        data, and its values can be linked to a [[Conceptual Domain]] to provide additional context.
    official_definition: a set of Permissible Values

        <p>A value domain provides a set of permissible values by which a [[data element]]
        can be implemented. Value domains can be enumerated (e.g. Total centimetres NNN)
        or non-enumerated (e.g. Sex code N).</p>
        
            <p>The union of a specific value domain with a specific [[data element concept]]
            creates a [[data element]]. For example the data element concept
            <em>Person&mdash;body height</em> can be implemented through union
            with the <em>Total centimetres NNN</em> value domain. </p>

        <p>ISO/IEC 11179 allows for 2 different types of Value Domains - enumerated vs non-enumerated.
        The distinction between these is that an enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a list of all its Value Meanings</q>,
        while a non-enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a description rather than a list of all Permissible Values</q>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a enumerated value domain</em> would be a list of 10-year cohorts for recording a persons age:
                <ul>
                    <li> A code of A coresponsing to 0-15 years
                    <li> A code of B coresponsing to 15-30 years
                    <li> A code of C coresponsing to 30-45 years
                    <li> A code of D coresponsing to 45+ years
                </ul>
                Here, every possible value within the set has been explicitly enumerated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a non-enumerated value domain</em> would be an numeric range for recording a persons age,
                where the number could be any two digit number greater than zero. While there is an implied set of values, these have not been expressly enumerated.

        <p>Value_Domain is a class each instance of which models a value domain (3.2.140), a set
        of permissible values (3.2.96). A value domain provides representation, but has no implication
        as to the [[data element concept]] (3.2.29) with which the values are associated, nor what the values mean.</p>
        <p>
        A Value_Domain is an abstract class which is used to denote a collection of Permissible_Values associated with
        a Conceptual_Domain (11.3.2.1). A Value_Domain has two possible subclasses: an Enumerated_Value_Domain (11.3.2.6)
        and a Described_Value_Domain (11.3.2.8). A Value_Domain must be either one or both an Enumerated Valued or a Described_Value_Domain.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 'ISO 3166 Codes for the representation of names of countries' 
        describes seven distinct Value_Domains for the single Conceptual_Domain 'names of countries'.
        The seven Value_Domains are:
            'short name in English',
            'official name in English', 
            'short name in French', 
            'official name in French',
            'alpha-2 code', 
            'alpha-3 code' 
            and 'numeric code'.

        It is a concrete subclass of the abstract class Value_Domain. As a subclass of Value_Domain, a 
        Described_Value_Domain inherits the attributes and relationships of the former.
