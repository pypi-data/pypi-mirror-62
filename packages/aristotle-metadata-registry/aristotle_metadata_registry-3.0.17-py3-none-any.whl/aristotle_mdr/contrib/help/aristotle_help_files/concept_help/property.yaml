    brief: A Property is an attribute common to all members of a set of things defined by an [[Object Class]].

        Quality common to all members of an [[Object Class]]

    body: >
        <p>A property is a characteristic of an object class of interest. For example,
        the object class Person can have characteristics such as <em>sex</em> and
        <em>date of birth</em>.
        These characteristics are referred to as properties.</p>
        
        <p>The union of a specific property with a specific
        [[objectclass]] creates a [[dataelementconcept]].
        The above mentioned examples create the data element concepts
        <em>Person—sex</em> and <em>Person—date of birth</em>.</p>

        <p>Property is a class each instance of which models a property (3.2.100), 
        a quality common to all members of an object class (3.2.88). 
        A property may be any feature that humans naturally use to distinguish one individual 
        object from another. It is the human perception of a single quality of an object class 
        in the real world. 
        It is conceptual and thus has no particular associated means of representation by which
        the property can be communicated.
        </p>
        <p>A Property may have a data_element_concept_property association (11.2.3.1) 
        with zero or more Data_Element_Concepts (11.2.2.3).

        Properties are specific <em>attributes</em> from things we wish to collect information about.
        Good names for properties are short, descriptive nouns.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be generic:</strong> A property should apply to all members of an Object Class</li>
          <li><strong>Properties are unitless:</strong> They should be describe some aspect of a thing, without prescribing how that aspect is measured.
          For example, <em>height</em> is an attribute of all people regardless of how it is measured.
          </li>
          <!--  <li><strong>:</strong></li> -->
        </ul>
        
        <!-- {% comment %}
        If you are unsure, use the name of your object class in the contexts below.
        <ul>
          <li>Measure of the age of <em>noun.</em></li>
          <li>Comparing the yearly income of <em>nouns</em> and private companies</li>
        </ul>
        In these examples, <q>Comparing the yearly income of <em>Persons</em> and private companies</q> makes sense,
        but <q>Measure of the age of <em>Wages.</em></q> does not - wages is an attribute of people or businesses.
