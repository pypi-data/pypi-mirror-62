    brief: A Data Element Derivation describes a standardised rule or equation that transforms
        a set of input Data Elements to produce a set of output [[Data Element|s]].
        application of a derivation rule to one or more input
    official_definition: >
        application of a derivation rule to one or more input [[data element|s]]
        to derive one or more output data elements.

        <p>A data element derivation is a formal description of how a particular
        [[data element]] can be calculated based on the values of other
        data elements.
        </p>
        <p>For example, a data element describing a
        <em>Person-Body Mass Index, BMI Value</em> can be derived from
        the data elements <em>Person-Weight, Kg</em> and
        <em>Person-Height, cm</em> according to the derivation rule
        <tt>BMI = Weight/Height<sup>2</sup></tt>.

        <p>Data_Element_Derivation is a class each instance of which models a

        <p>Data_Element_Derivation is a class that associates the Data_Element(s) (11.5.2.1)
        that serve as sources or inputs with a Derivation_Rule (11.5.2.5) and the
        Data_Element(s) that are the products or outputs of the Derivation_Rule.

        <p>Derivation_Rule is a class each instance of which models a derivation rule (3.2.45),
        logical, mathematical, and/or other operations specifying derivation.
        The Derivation_Rule may range from a simple operation such as subtraction to a 
        very complex set of derivations (derivation being defined as a relationship 
        between a Derivation_Rule and an input set upon which it acts). 
        Derivation_Rules are not limited to arithmetic and logical operations.
        </p>
        <p>A Derivation_Rule may have a derivation_rule_application association with zero or more application 
        Data_Element_Derivations, where the Derivation_Rule provides the rule for the associated Data_Element_Derivation.
        </p>
        <p>A Derivation_Rule may be registered as a Registered_Item without necessarily being associated with any
        Data_Element_Derivation. As a Registered_Item, a Derivation_Rule is directly or indirectly
        associated with an Administration_Record and can be identified, named, defined and optionally 
        classified as a Classifiable_Item in a Classification_Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>Every Derivation_Rule must have exactly one derivation_rule_specification of
        type Text that specifies the rule semantics.
        </p>
        <p>Every Derivation_Rule must have exactly one derivation_rule_notation of type Notation that specifies
        the syntax and semantics used in the derivation_rule_specification.
