    brief: "A Data Element Concept defines an idea that could be recorded by data, without specifying how it would be stored or measured.
        Data Element Concepts are composed of an [[Object Class]], which describes the thing of interest, and a [[Property]] that defines which attribute of the thing would be recorded.
        Data Element Concepts can be referenced by multiple different Data Elements that each specify the Value Domain used to record the data."
    official_definition: >
        Concept that is an association of a [[Property]] with an [[Object Class]]

    body: >
        <p>A data element concept represents the union of an [[objectclass]] and a
        [[property]]. Examples of data element concepts include concepts such as,
        <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>date of birth</em>, <em>Person</em> &mdash;
        <em>country of birth</em>, and <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>religious
        affiliation</em>.</p>
        
        <p>A data element concept is solely a conceptual description
        and does not include values for measurement or collection.
        Values are described by a [[valuedomain]], which in combination with
        the data element concept forms a [[dataelement]].</p>
        
        <p>A [[conceptualdomain]] may also be associated with a data element concept,
        thereby providing meaning to the values associated with the concept.
        A one-to-many relationship may be formed between a data element concept
        and suitable conceptual domains.</p>

        <cite><a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">

        <p>Data_Element_Concept is a class each instance of which models a data element concept (3.2.29).
        A data element concept is a specification of a concept (3.2.18) independent of any particular
        representation. A data element concept can be represented in the form of a [[data element]] (3.2.28).
        </p>
        <p>A Data_Element_Concept may have a data_element_concept_object_class association (11.2.3.3)
        with zero or one Object_Class (11.2.2.1) and a data_element_concept_property association (11.2.3.1)
        with zero or one Property (11.2.2.2).
        </p>
        <p>The combination of a [[property]] (3.2.100) and an [[object class]] (3.2.88) provides significance 
        beyond either that of the property or the object class. A Data_Element_Concept thus has a 
        Definition (7.3.2.4) independent of the Definition of the Object_Class or the Property.
        </p>
        <p>Every Data_Element_Concept must have exactly one data_element_concept_domain 
        association (11.2.3.2) with a Conceptual_Domain (11.3.2.1), where the Data_Element_Concept 
        supplies a usage for the associated Conceptual_Domain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An association between the Data_Element_Concept "Person Country of Residence"
        and the Conceptual_Domain "Country".
