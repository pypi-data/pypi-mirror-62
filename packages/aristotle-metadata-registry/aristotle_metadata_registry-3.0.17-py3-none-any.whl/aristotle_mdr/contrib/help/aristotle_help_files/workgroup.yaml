    title: What are workgroups?
    language: en
    body: >
        <p>
        <strong>A workgroup is an administrative collection of people working together
        to create a set of metadata for a specific purpose.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>Every item belongs to a workgroup, and this workgroup is used to determine the
        <a href="/help/how-does-content-become-visible">permissions
        around when and to whom an item is visible.</a>
        However, once an item is registered it become the property of the registry,
        rather than just the workgroup.
        </p>
        
        <p>Workgroups usually have one or more <a href="/help/registration-authorities">registration authorities</a>
        associated with them, and the workgroup is presumed to be creating content on behalf of these registration authorities.
        If a workgroup has no registration authority associated with it registration of items is not possible and items
        will be visible only to members of the workgroup and cannot be <a href="/help/what-makes-a-standard">standardised</a>.
        </p>
