        <h2>Using the superseding relationship</h2>
        <p>All <a href="{% url 'aristotle:about' 'concept11179' %}">11179 concepts</a>, such as Data Elements or Object Classes
        have the ability to indicate a formal relationship to other items which supersede

                It is possible for an editor to create two items that each indicates they supersede the other,
                leading to a circular relationship.
                <br>While Aristotle is able to handle content created in this way
                without breaking, a situation like this would not be semantically correct.

        <h2>Using the <tt>version</tt> attribute</h2>
        <p>Administered items can also be given a version marker.
        This can be a maximum of 20 characters long, with any form of number, letters and punctation.
        An agency or registration authority should have clear rules around what make a "valid" version marker.

                Version markers should <em>not</em> replace superseding items and the standardisation process.
                Once an item has been made standard it should rarely need to be changed.
                <br>If a new version of an item is to be created, this can be achieved by creating a new item, with an updated version.
                Once the new item is standardised, these two items can then be semantically linked via the superseding option.
