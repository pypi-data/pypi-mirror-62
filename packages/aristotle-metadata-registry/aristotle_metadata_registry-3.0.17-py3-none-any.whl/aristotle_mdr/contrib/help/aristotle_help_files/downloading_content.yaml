      <p>Each instance of an Aristotle Metadata Registry will have different
      provisions and formats available for downloading content from the
      registry.</p>
      <p>In general, downloads of individual items are made available through
      the download menu to the right of items name. This menu will list every different
      type of download format made available in this registry.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, you can download multiple items at a time when reviewing lists of metadata
      items, such as browse screens, favourite lists or lists of workgroup items.
      This is done by highlighting items and selecting "bulk download" from the bulk action dropdown box
      and then selecting the appropriate download format.
