    brief: An indicator describes a measure that is regularly reported for tracking performance
            of a process or policy, and provides relevant and actionable information about system
            performance. Indicators can reference [[aristotle_mdr.dataelement|s]] when defining 
            their component parts, such as numerators and denominators, and Indicators may be
            linked across multiple [[Indicator Set|s]] to track performance over time.
    official_definition: A particular characteristic or dimension used to measure intended changes
        defined by an organisational unit’s results framework. Performance indicators 
        are used to observe progress and to measure actual results compared to expected 
        results. They serve to answer “how” or “whether” a unit is progressing towards 
        its objectives, rather than “why” or “why not” such progress is being made. 
        
        Performance indicators are usually expressed in quantifiable terms, and should 
        be objective and measurable (e.g., numeric values, percentages, scores, and indices).

        <p>A health indicator is a single measure that is reported on regularly
        and that provides relevant and actionable information about population
        health and/or health system performance and characteristics.
        An indicator can provide comparable information, as well as track 
        progress and performance over time.
        </p>
        <p>Health indicators support provinces/territories, regional health
        authorities and facilities as they monitor the health of their populations
        and track how well their local health systems function.

        <p>The drivers for standard development arise from the
        need for better information - whether it is statistical, administrative,
        clinical or other information. This ensures the data used in statistics
        is compatible and it facilitates National and International interoperability.

    creation_tip: 
        <p>
        Indicators should be clearly defined and specify the [[aristotle_mdr.DataElement|s]]
        used in their calculations.
        If the resulting value type of an Indicator is known ahead of time it can
        be specified by attaching a [[aristotle_mdr.ValueDomain]] to clearly
        code the value and provides a valuable linkage to other similar indicators.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Once an indicator has been saved, numerator and denominator
        [[aristotle_mdr.DataElement|s]] as well as [[Outcome area|s]] can be
        attached from the Indicator page.
