    brief: An Outcome Area describes a strategic target or standard for a process or policy
            that may not be able to be measured directly or efficiently. An Outcome Area may
            be assesed by performance against a measurable [[Indicator]].
    official_definition: A statement that specifically defines the target,
        standard, or the ideal result of the indicator against which the
        indicator is to be assessed.

        <p>A statement that specifically defines the target, standard,
        or the ideal result of the indicator against which an [[indicator]]
        is to be assessed. Outcomes should be strategic, high level and
        observable, expressed in clear, measurable and achievable terms.
        Several outcome areas may be identified for each objective.

        <p>
        The union of a specific outcome area with a specific indicator
        set and an indicator creates a performance indicator for a 
        specific agreement.

        For example, the <em>People with disability 
        achieve economic participation and social inclusion</em> outcome 
        area can be combined with <em>National Disability Agreement</em>
        [[indicator set]] and <em>Labour force participation rate for people with disability
        aged 15-64 years, 2011</em> [[indicator]] to create the performance 
        indicator,
        <em>National Disability Agreement: a(3)-Labour force participation 
        rate for people with disability aged 15-64 years, 2011.</em>

        Once an Outcome Area has been saved, you can attach [[indicator|s]]
        from the saved Outcome Area page.
