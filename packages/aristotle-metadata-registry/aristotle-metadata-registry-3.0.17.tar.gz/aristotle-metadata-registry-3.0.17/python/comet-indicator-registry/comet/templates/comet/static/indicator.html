{% block description %}
<p>A metric used to evaluate or benchmark factors which impact upon society, such as the number of vaccinations for a specific disease and by extension the incidence of the disease in the community.</P> 

<P>An indicator may be associated with a number of other metadata items, including an indicator set, framework, data element, data set specification, data source and outcome area. </P>

{#<p>An indicator set groups indicators with associated indicators, thereby establishing a thematic collection of performance measures. </p>
<p>An indicator may also be associated with outcome areas which identify a target, standard, or the ideal result against which the indicator is to be assessed. </P>
<p>Indicators have thirty attributes which are unique within METeOR: Indicator Type, Indicator common name,  Description, Rationale, Indicator set, Outcome area, Population group age from, Population group age to, Computation description, Formulae, Numerator, Numerator items, Denominator, Denominator items, Disaggregation items, Data element/Data set, Data source, NMDS/DSS, Collection Methods/Guide for use, Framework and dimensions, Methodology, Formulae, Reporting requirements, Organisation responsible for providing data, Accountability, Benchmark, International comparisons, Further data development/collection required, Other issues caveats, and Release date.

<p>The union of an indicator with a specific indicator set and a specific outcome area creates an indicator for a specific agreement
For example, the <em>National Disability Agreement</em> indicator set can be combined with <em>People with disability achieve economic
participation and social inclusion</em> outcome area and <em>Labour force participation rate for people with disability aged 15-64 years
, 2011</em> indicator to create the indicator:

<br><em>National Disability Agreement: a(3)-Labour force participation rate for people with disability aged 15-64 years, 2011.</em>#}
