{% block description %}
    <p>An objective against which the success of an indicator can be measured. Outcome areas should be strategically focused, while remaining both measurable and achieveable in practice. For example, the Council Of Australian Governments (COAG) has implemented Outcome Areas to describe specific objectives for the success of their indicators. These include high level statements used in the National Indigenous Reform Agreement (NIRA) such as Indigenous children have the same health outcomes as other Australian children, and Indigenous Australians achieve health outcomes comparable to the broader population.</P>
