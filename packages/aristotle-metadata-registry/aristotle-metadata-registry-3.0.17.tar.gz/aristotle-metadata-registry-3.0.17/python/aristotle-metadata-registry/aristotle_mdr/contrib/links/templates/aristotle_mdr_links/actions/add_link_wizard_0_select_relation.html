<hr>
    <p>A Relation is a template for a link, that defines the behaviour for the saved link, such as the
        number of metadata items that can be included in the link and the roles these metadata items have
        for the link.
    </p>
    <p>
       To learn more about a Relation, click the blue icon (<i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i>) in the drop down to
       view the relation definition in a new window.
    </p>
