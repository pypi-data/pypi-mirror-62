    brief: An Object Class defines a way of identifying or classifying a set of 
        real objects, ideas or events that all share common measurable attributes.
    official_definition: >
        Set of ideas, abstractions or things in the real world that are
        identified with explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties and
        behaviour follow the same rules

    body: >
        <p>An object class represents a person, organisation, structure or event that
        is of interest and needs to be described.  Examples of object classes include
        <em>Person, Dwelling</em> and <em>Family</em>.</p>
    
        <p>The union of a specific object class with a specific property creates a data
        element concept. For example, some of the above mentioned object classes can be
        combined with an <em>Religious affiliation</em> property to create the data
        element concepts: <em>Person &mdash; religious affiliation</em> and <em>Family
        &mdash; religious affiliation</em>.</p>
    
        <p>Object classes can be specialisations of other object classes.  For example,
        <em>Adult</em> is an age group related specialisation of <em>Person</em>.</p>
    
        <p>Specialisations allow object classes to be grouped and subtyped in a
        meaningful manner and help users in browsing and locating relevant object
        classes. In a specialisation tree an object class can only be associated with a
        single parent object class but may have more than one child object classes. A
        child object class inherits all characteristics of its parent object class, but
        a child object class may have unique characteristics.</p>

        <cite><a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">

        <p>Object_Class is a class each instance of which models an object class (3.2.88).
        An object class is a concept (3.2.18) that represents a set of ideas, abstractions,
        or things in the real world that can be identified with explicit boundaries and meaning
        and whose properties and behavior follow the same rules.
        It may be either a single or a group of associated concepts, abstractions, or things.
        </p>
        <p>An Object_Class may have a data_element_concept_object_class association (11.2.3.3)
        with zero or more Data_Element_Concepts (11.2.2.3), where the object class describes the 
        ideas, abstractions or things in the real world that are represented by the 
        data element concepts (3.2.29).        
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Object_Class "Person" could be associated with the Data_Element_Concept "Person height".
        </p>

    creation_tip: >
        Object classes are <em>things</em> we wish to collect information about.
        Good names for object classes are short, descriptive nouns.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Be generic:</strong> An object class should apply to the widest group possible.
          Only make more specific classes, if there are particular attributes only found on the specialisation.
          e.g. Person, not Australian Citizens</li>
          <li><strong>Use singlar forms:</strong> When discusing individuals, use singular terms to ensure unambiguity. For example, a <em>Person</em> can have an age, but a <em>Group of people</em> has an average age.</li>
          <!--  <li><strong>:</strong></li> -->
        </ul>
        
        <!--
        If you are unsure, use the name of your object class in the contexts below.
        <ul>
          <li>Measure of the age of <em>noun.</em></li>
          <li>Comparing the yearly income of <em>nouns</em> and private companies</li>
        </ul>
        In these examples, <q>Comparing the yearly income of <em>Persons</em> and
        private companies</q> makes sense, but <q>Measure of the age of <em>Wages.</em></q>
        does not - wages is an attribute of people or businesses.-->
