        <p>
        A Metadata Registry (MDR) is a database of metadata that supports the functionality of registration. ...
        An MDR manages the semantics of data. Understanding data is fundamental to its design, harmonization,
        standardization, use, re-use, and interchange. The underlying model for an MDR is designed to capture all
        the basic components of the semantics of data, independent of any application or subject matter area.
