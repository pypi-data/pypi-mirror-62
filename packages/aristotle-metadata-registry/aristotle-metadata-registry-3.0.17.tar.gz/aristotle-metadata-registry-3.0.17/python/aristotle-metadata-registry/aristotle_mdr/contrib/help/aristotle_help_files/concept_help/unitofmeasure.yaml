    brief: A Unit of Measure describes units (eg. metres, litres, seconds) which can be used to
      record a measurement. A [[Value Domain]] can link to a single Unit of Measure to describe
      the units used to measure the associated data which can be used when to finding or 
      comparing similar data.
    official_definition: >
        Actual units in which the associated values are measured

        <P>The units in which the values in a value domain are measured. Adding unit of measure information makes the value more 
        meaningful, especially in instances where a concept can be measured using various units of measure. For example, length or distance may be measured in millimetres, centimetres, inches, metres, feet, kilometres or miles etc.</P>
        <P>While units of measure are specifically related to value domains, they are impertive to the formation of well described 
        data elements.</P>
