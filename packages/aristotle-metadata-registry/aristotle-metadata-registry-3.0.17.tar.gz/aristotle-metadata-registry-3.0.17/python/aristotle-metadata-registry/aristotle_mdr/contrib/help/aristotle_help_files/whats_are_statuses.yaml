        <p>
        The ISO 11179 standards defines a range of registration status levels 
        that help users of a registry understand the endorsement of metadata for
        its use in certain domains. Within the 11179 standard, these levels are given 
        using broad criteria that allow registration authorities to specify the exact
        meaning of each status level.
        
        </p>
        <p>
        The Aristotle Metadata Registry allows registration authorities to  record
        the meaning of status levels so that users looking for metadata can quickly determine
        the who has endorsed metadata and for what purpose. By clicking the name of a registration
        authority a user can quickly jump to the registration authority home page to
        see their definitions for each status level.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example:
        <div class="help_example">
        A <i>Federal Department of Education</i> has defined the status level of "standard"
        to be applicable for any metadata that has been endorsed by a majority of a council
        of education superintendents.
        </div>
        Then, if a user sees metadata item (such as a question or [[data element]])
        with the status of 'standard', they can be certain that it is endorsed for use
        when dealing with education data at a federal level.
        </p>
        <p>
        Below is an extract from ISO/IEC 11179-6 that explains status levels in more depth.

        <header>4.4.2 Summary of registration status categories</header>
        <p>
        Registration status specifies the state of an Administered Item that is in the metadata register, in the
        view of the Registration Authority. Registration status categories shall apply to individual Administered
        Items that have been registered in the metadata register by the Registration Authority. Registration
        status categories are of two sub-types: lifecycle and documentation. The lifecycle registration status
        categories address improvement and progression towards levels of perfection of the quality of the
        metadata of the item and of the preferences of usage of the Administered Item. The documentation
        registration status categories are used to denote positions at which there will be no more progression
        in quality of metadata or use of the Administered Item. The relationships among these status categories,
        along with the requirements for an Administered Item to achieve a particular registration status level,
        are presented in Table 1.

        While the general intent is to progress as many Administered Items as possible from “Incomplete” 
        to the “Preferred Standard” registration status, progression to a status higher than “Recorded”
        or “Qualified” may not be appropriate. That is, necessary metadata attribute documentation for 
        an Administered Item may not be available to establish required documentation for the “Recorded”
        status, may not be of the quality necessary for the “Qualified” status, or identification as
        “Preferred Standard” Administered Item may not be appropriate.
