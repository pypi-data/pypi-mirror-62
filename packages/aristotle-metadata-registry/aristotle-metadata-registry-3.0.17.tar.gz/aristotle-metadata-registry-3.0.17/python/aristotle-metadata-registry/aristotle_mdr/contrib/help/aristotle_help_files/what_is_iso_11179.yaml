      <p>
      ISO/IEC 11179 is an international standard for describing metadata registries that
      defines the technical, structural and governance requirements for describing the
      structure of data in a reusable way.

      <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">
      Electronic copies of the ISO/IEC 11179 specification are made freely
      accessible on the ISO website.

      <p>
      The Aristotle Metadata Registry is a software implementation of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard
      that allows agencies to run their own standard conformat registries.

      The primary purpose of ISO/IEC 11179-3 is to specify the structure of a Metadata Registry.
      ISO/IEC 11179-3 also specifies basic attributes which are required to describe metadata items, and which
      may be used in situations where a complete metadata registry is not appropriate (e.g. in the specification of
      other International Standards).
