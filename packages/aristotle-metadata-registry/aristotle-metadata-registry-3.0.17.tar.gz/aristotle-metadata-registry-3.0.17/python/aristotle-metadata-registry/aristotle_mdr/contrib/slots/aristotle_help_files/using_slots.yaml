      <blockquote>
      Slot instances provide a dynamic way to add arbitrary attributes to instances of on Identified_Item (7.2.2.1).
      A Slot instance is associated with exactly one Identified_Item instance, through the association item_slot (7.2.3.3).
      An Identified_Item instance may be associated with zero, one or more Slot instances.
      All Slot instances associated with a particular Identified_Item instance must 
      have a distinct name to allow each Slot instance to be unambiguously identified.
