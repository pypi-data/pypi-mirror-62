Aristotle Metadata Registry - self publishing
=============================================

Enabling this in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` allows users to self-publish
content without having to register it.

Research suggests that the ISO/IEC 11179 specification has no rulings on the
relationships of registration status and publication so this is a per-registry
administration option.
