Description: # éritage GO Core Python Library 
        
        Héritage GO Core Python Library is a repository of reusable Python
        components shared by other Héritage GO Python projects.
        
        These components have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that
        they can be deployed easily.  In addition, these components will keep
        their interfaces as stable as possible, so that other Python projects
        can integrate these components without having to worry about changes
        in the future.
