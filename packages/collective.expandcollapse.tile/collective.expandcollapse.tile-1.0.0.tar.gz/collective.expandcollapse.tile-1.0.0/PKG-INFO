        Usage
        -----
        
        To enable expand/collapse feature in a tile, you only need to add a specific CSS class to it.
        
        Some tiles like `collective.tiles.advancedstatic <https://github.com/collective/collective.tiles.advancedstatic>`_ or `collective.tiles.collection <https://github.com/collective/collective.tiles.collection>`_ 
        have a field in their configuration that allows to add custom CSS classes.
        
        Possible classes are:
        
        - **collapsible-desktop**: enable expand/collapse feature for Desktop displays (width > 991px)
        - **collapsible**: enable expand/collapse for small screens only (width < 991px)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.expandcollapse.tile by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.expandcollapse.tile
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
        
        After that, you need to install the product "Expand/Collapse tile" in your Plone site.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        All resources are compiled with grunt.
        
        First of all, you need to setup your development environment inside project root::
        
            > npm install
        
        Then, you need to activate grunt in watch-mode::
            
            > npm run develop
        
        After that, you can edit *expand_collapse.js* or *styles.scss* files and resources will be automatically compiled in *dist* folder.
        
        You can also force compilation with this command::
        
            > npm run compile
