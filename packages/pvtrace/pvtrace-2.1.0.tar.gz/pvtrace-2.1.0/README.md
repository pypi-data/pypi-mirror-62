> Optical ray tracing for luminescent materials and spectral converter photovoltaic devices 

## Install

    pip install pvtrace

## Introduction

pvtrace is a statistical photon path tracer written in Python. It follows photons through a 3D scene and records their interactions with objects to build up statistical information about energy flow. This approach is particularly useful in photovoltaics and non-imaging optics where the goal is to design systems which efficiently transport light to target locations.

## Documentation

Interactive Jupyter notebooks are in [examples directory](https://github.com/danieljfarrell/pvtrace/tree/master/examples), download and take a look, although they can be viewed online.

## Capabilities

pvtrace was originally written to characterise the performance of Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) and takes a Monte-Carlo approach to ray-tracing. Each ray is independent and can interact with objects in the scene via reflection and refraction. Objects can have different optical properties: refractive index, absorption coefficient, emission spectrum and quantum yield.

One of the key features of pvtrace is the ability to simulate re-absorption of photons in luminescent materials. This requires following thousands of rays to build intensity profiles and spectra of incoming and outgoing photons because these process cannot be approximated in a continuous way.

pvtrace may also be useful to researches or designers interested in ray-optics simulations but will be slower at running these simulations compared to other software packages because it follows each ray individually.

A minimal working example that traces a glass sphere

```python
import time
import sys
import functools
import numpy as np
from pvtrace import *

world = Node(
    name="world (air)",
    geometry=Sphere(
        radius=10.0,
        material=Material(refractive_index=1.0),
    )
)

sphere = Node(
    name="sphere (glass)",
    geometry=Sphere(
        radius=1.0,
        material=Material(refractive_index=1.5),
    ),
    parent=world
)
sphere.location = (0, 0, 2)

light = Node(
    name="Light (555nm)",
    light=Light(direction=functools.partial(cone, np.pi/8)),
    parent=world
)

renderer = MeshcatRenderer(wireframe=True, open_browser=True)
scene = Scene(world)
renderer.render(scene)
for ray in scene.emit(100):
    steps = photon_tracer.follow(scene, ray)
    path, events = zip(*steps)
    renderer.add_ray_path(path)
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Wait for Ctrl-C to terminate the script; keep the window open
print("Ctrl-C to close")
while True:
    try:
        time.sleep(.3)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        sys.exit()
```
