        # Description
        
        **Instrumental-downloader** was created as a command-line tool used to download a list of instrumentals based on just the song name.(and sometimes the artist is needed to identify the song) This tool is based off of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), a tool used to download youtube videos from their url. The Python interpreter version 3.6+ is needed for this program. FFprobe/ ffmpeg needs to be installed in the PATH, as that is the program used to download instrumentals as mp3 files. 
        
            instrumental-dl -f FILE_NAME
            instrumental-dl -s "SONG_NAMES" ["SONG_NAMES"...]
              (with -s the song name needs to be in quotations
              if it contains any spaces)
