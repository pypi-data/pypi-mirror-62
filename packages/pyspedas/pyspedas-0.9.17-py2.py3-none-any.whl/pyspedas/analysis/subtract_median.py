Description:
    Subtracts the median from the data.

Parameters:
    names: str/list of str
        List of pytplot names.
    new_names: str/list of str
        List of new_names for pytplot variables.
        If '', then pytplot variables are replaced.
        If not given, then a suffix is applied.
    suffix:
        A suffix to apply. Default is '-m'.

Notes:
    Allowed wildcards are ? for a single character, * from multiple characters.
