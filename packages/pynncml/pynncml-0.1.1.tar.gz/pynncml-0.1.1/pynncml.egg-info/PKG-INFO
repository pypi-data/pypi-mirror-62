        # PyNNcml
        A python toolbox based on PyTorch which utilized neural network for rain estimation and classification from commercial microwave link (CMLs) data. This toolbox provides an implementation of algorithms for extracting rain-rate using neural networks and CMLs. Addinaly this project provides an example dataset with data from two CMLs and implementation of performance and robustness metrics.

        # Model Zoo
        In this project we supply a set of trained networks in our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haihabi/torch_rain/tree/master/torchrain/model_zoo), this networks are trained on our own dataset which is not publicly available.
        The model contains three types of networks: Wet-dry classification network, one-step network (rain estimation only) and two-step network (rain estimation and wet-dry classification). Moreover, we have provided all of these networks with a various number of RNN cells (1, 2, 3). From more details about network structure and results see the publication list.
