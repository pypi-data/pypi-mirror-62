Description: # PyMODAlib
        
        `PyMODAlib` is a Python library containing the algorithms used by PyMODA. 
        
        Some of these algorithms are MATLAB-packaged libraries, while some are Python translations of MODA's algorithms.
        
        ## Installing PyMODAlib
        
        `PyMODAlib` can be installed using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install PyMODAlib
        ```
        
        ## Current status
        
        `PyMODAlib` is still early in development. Currently, the features implemented are:
        
        - Detecting harmonics.
        
        ## Examples
        
        There are examples of using PyMODAlib's functions in the `examples` directory.
        
        ## Developer notes
        
        ### Developing PyMODAlib
        
        When developing PyMODAlib, you can test your changes by installing the library locally. From the root of the repository, run:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Packaging the project
        
        From the [documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project):
        
        ```bash
        rm -r dist/
        python setup.py sdist
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
