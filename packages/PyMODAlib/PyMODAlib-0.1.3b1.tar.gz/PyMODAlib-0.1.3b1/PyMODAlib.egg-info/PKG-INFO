        PyMODAlib is a Python library containing the algorithms used by [PyMODA](https://github.com/luphysics/PyMODA). PyMODAlib can be used to programmatically perform time-frequency analysis.
        
        Some of PyMODAlib's algorithms are MATLAB-packaged libraries, while some are Python translations of algorithms belonging to [MODA](https://github.com/luphysics/MODA).
        
        ## Installing PyMODAlib
        
        PyMODAlib can be installed using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install pymodalib
        ```
        
        ## Current status
        
        `PyMODAlib` is still early in development. Currently, the features implemented are:
        
        - Detecting harmonics.
        
        ## Examples
        
        There are examples of using PyMODAlib's functionality in the `examples` directory.

        ## Developer notes
        
        ### Developing PyMODAlib
        
        When developing PyMODAlib, you can test your changes by installing the library locally in "editable" mode. From the root of the repository, run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        > **Tip:** After making changes to PyMODAlib, you don't need to run the `pip install` command again.
        
        Switching back to the release version of PyMODAlib is simple:
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall pymodalib -y
        pip install pymodalib
        ```
        
        ### Packaging the project
        
        From the [documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project):
        
        ```bash
        rm -r dist/
        python setup.py sdist
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
