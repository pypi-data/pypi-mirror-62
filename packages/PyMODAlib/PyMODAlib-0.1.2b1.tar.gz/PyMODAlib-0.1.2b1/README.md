## Developer notes

### Developing PyMODAlib

When developing PyMODAlib, you can test your changes by installing the library locally in "editable" mode. From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Tip:** After making changes to PyMODAlib, you don't need to run the `pip install` command again.

Switching back to the release version of PyMODAlib is simple:

```bash
pip uninstall pymodalib -y
pip install pymodalib
```

### Packaging the project

From the [documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project):

```bash
rm -r dist/
python setup.py sdist
python setup.py bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```
