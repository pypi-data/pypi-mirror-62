## Almost there.

Now you just need to mixin the ActionMixin to your views. Here's an example of how that might look:

```
# for older versions of django rest framework
# from actions.legacy import ActionMixin
from actions.mixins import ActionMixin
from {{appname}}.actions.action_registry import ACTIONS

..

class {{resource}}ViewSet(ActionMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = {{resource}}.objects.all()
    serializer_class = {{resource}}Serializer
    action_registry = ACTIONS
```
