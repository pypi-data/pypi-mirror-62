"""
The *common* subpackage contains several helpful multi-purpose modules, classes and functions,
that are not necessarily GIS-related (for GIS tools, see the :py:mod:`gpf.tools` subpackage).
Think evaluation, text formatting, file path handling and so on.

The functions in this subpackage are used by other *gpf* subpackages, but can also be called in user scripts.
