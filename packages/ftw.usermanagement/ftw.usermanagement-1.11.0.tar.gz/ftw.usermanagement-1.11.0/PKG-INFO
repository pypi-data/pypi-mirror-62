Description: ftw.usermanagement
        ==================
        
        This package allows users to easily manage users and groups through
        a new view without having plone's manage portal permission. This is useful
        when the person who manages users and groups should have full manager access
        to the site.
        
        If the user has the permission "Manage users", a new action is displayed in
        the user menu, giving him the ability to list and modify users and groups.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Manage users
        
          - List users
          - Assign users to groups
          - Add users
          - Delete users
          - Reset password of a user and send a notification
        
        - Manage groups
        
          - List groups
          - Add groups
          - Delete groups
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        If you are using ``zc.buildout`` and the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        - Add ``ftw.usermanagement`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                ftw.usermanagement
        
        - Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        - Install the generic setup profile.
        
        - Grant chosen users the ``zope2.ManageUsers`` ("Manage users") permission.
