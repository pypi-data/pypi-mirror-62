Description: # Fuzzy system
        Just a other python fuzzy rule-based system and reasoning package.
        Based on the lecture's given by Ning Xiong at Märlardalens University.
        Writen and implmented by @byteofsoren.
        
        
        # Installation.
        ```
        pip install fuzzy_system
        
        ```
        # Basic usage
        Assume that intended system for opening a valve dependent on price of electricity and the temperature in the environment.
        
        Assume that the fuzzy set for the temperature and cost looks like this:
        ![Temperature](images/temperature.png)
        ![Electricity cost](images/electrisity_cost.png)
        This is implemented like this in this module:
        ``` python
        >>> import python_fuzzy_system as fuzzy
        
        >>> cold = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[-5,1],[5,0]])
        >>> warm = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[0,0],[5,1],[10,1],[15,0]])
        >>> hot = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[5,0],[15,1]])
        
        >>> cheap = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[8,1],[12,0]])
        >>> good = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[8,0],[12,1],[16,0]])
        >>> expensive = fuzzy.fuzzy_member_pointlist([[12,0],[16,1]])
        ```
        Now fire each individual member can be done like:
        ``` python
        >>> cold.fire(1.5)
        0.35
        ```
        
        # Creating rules for the system
        Lets define a set of rules called Rn.
        |Rule| Condition | Do |
        |---|---|---|
        | R1 | If Cheap AND Cold | Then Open |
        | R2 | If Hot AND (Cheep OR good) | Then HalfOpen |
        | R3 | If Expensive AND Hot | Then Closed
        
        
        ``` Python
        r1 = cheep*cold
        r2 = hot*(cheep + good)
        r3 = expensive*hot
        ```
