    [`bug 1810983 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1810983>`_]
    With the removal of KeystoneToken from the token model, we longer
    have the ability to use the token data syntax in the policy rules.
    This change broke backward compatibility for anyone deploying
    customized Keystone policies. Unfortunately, we can't go back
    to KeystoneToken model as the change was tightly coupled with
    the other refactored authorization functionalities.

    Since the scope information is now available in the credential
    dictionary, we can just make use of it instead. Those who have
    custom policies must update their policy files accordingly.
