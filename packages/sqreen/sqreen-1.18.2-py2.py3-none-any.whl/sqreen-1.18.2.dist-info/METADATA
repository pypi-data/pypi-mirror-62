# [Sqreen](https://www.sqreen.com/)'s Application Security Management for Python

After performance monitoring (APM), error and log monitoring it’s time to add a
security component into your app. Sqreen’s microagent automatically monitors
sensitive app’s routines, blocks attacks and reports actionable infos to your
dashboard.

![Dashboard](https://sqreen-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/miscellaneous/dashboard.gif)

Sqreen provides automatic defense against attacks:

- Protect with security modules: RASP (Runtime App Self-Protection), In-App WAF
  (Web Application Firewall), Account takeovers [and more](https://www.sqreen.com/modules).

- Sqreen’s modules adapt to your application stack with no need of
  configuration.

- Prevent attacks from the OWASP Top 10 (Injections, XSS and more), 0-days,
  Data Leaks, and more.

- Create security automation playbooks that automatically react against
  advanced business-logic threats.

## Installation

1. Install Sqreen for Python using a recent version of `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install sqreen
   ```

2. [Signup to Sqreen](https://my.sqreen.com/signup) to get a token for your
   application and write it in a configuration file called `sqreen.ini` in the
   root directory of your project:
   ```ini
   [sqreen]
   token: Your token
   app_name: My Application
   ```

3. Import the `sqreen` module at the top of your application (usually the
   `app.py` or `wsgi.py` file):
   ```python
   import sqreen
   sqreen.start()
   ```

   Alternatively, if you don't want to modify your application, you can also
   start Sqreen by prepending your web server command line with `sqreen-start`:
   ```sh
   sqreen-start gunicorn app.wsgi
   ```
