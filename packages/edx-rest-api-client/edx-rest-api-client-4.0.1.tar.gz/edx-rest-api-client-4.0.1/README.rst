The edX REST API Client (henceforth, client) allows users to communicate with various edX REST APIs, including the `E-Commerce Service`_ and the `Programs Service`_.

Clients & REST API Clients code
-------------------------------

Open edX services, including LMS, should use the OAuthAPIClient class to make OAuth2 client requests and REST API calls.

Additional Requirements
-----------------------

The OAuthAPIClient uses the TieredCache internally for caching.  Read more about the `requirements of TieredCache`_, which include Django caching and some custom middleware.
