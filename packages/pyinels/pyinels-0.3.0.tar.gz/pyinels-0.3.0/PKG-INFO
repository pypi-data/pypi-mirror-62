Description: PyInels
        ========
        A Python library that handles communication with proprietary home intelligent system
        named [iNels](https://www.inels.com/) by ElkoEP company.
        
        This package is developed against iNels BUS CU3 version. It is not tested on older
        version CU2 and does not support RF components.

        ```
        
        Reason
        ======
        I wrote PyInels library to use it for [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration.
        
        Watch Feature
        =============
        In the future I would like to rewrite the library with better efficiency such ass [Asyncio](https://blog.heroku.com/python37-dataclasses-async-await#asyncio-and-the-code-async-code-code-await-code-keywords).
