    This release fixes the issue that functionality had been implemented
    in the previous release to handle up to microversion 3.55 of the Block
    Storage API, but the cinderclient was under the impression that it
    could only handle up to microversion 3.52.
issues:
  - |
    There is a possible backward incompatability issue that could affect
    consumers of the
    ``cinderclient.client.get_highest_client_server_version(url)`` method.
    It might have been expected that the 4.0.x series of releases would be
    capped at microversion 3.52; however, in this release, that method may
    return up to microversion 3.55.  Ordinarily, this would be signaled by
    incrementing the minor version of the cinderclient; however, that cannot
    be done for this release because the 4.1.x series has already been
    released from the stein branch.
upgrade:
  - |
    This version of the cinderclient can communicate with the Block Storage
    API up to microversion 3.55.  The previous release could only handle up
    to microversion 3.52.
