        Install by `pip install bandaid` with Python 3.x only.
        
        ## Client
        
        1. CLI to provide all interactive functionality
            - Use case is "Show me Aerosmith" and it will mark as watching and also whether on tour or now
        2. Modules to integrate into other code (`from bandaid import bandaid`)
        
        3. Agent (Watchlist manager and band tour status query)
            - Mark bands that you want to watch for and know when on tour and if coming to town
            - Use SQLite database to track and update
        
        ```bash
        $ python3 agent.py -h
        usage: agent.py [-h] [-b BANDNAME [BANDNAME ...]] [-w] [-f]
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -b BANDNAME [BANDNAME ...], --band BANDNAME [BANDNAME ...]
                                band to lookup
          -w, --watchlist       add to watchlist
          -f, --fetch           fetch a band (with -b flag) or no extra flag for all bands tracking current status
