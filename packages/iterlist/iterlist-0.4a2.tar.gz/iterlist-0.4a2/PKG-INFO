Description: # iterlist
        
        Lazily evaluated lists in Python
        
        An `iterlist.IterList` accepts a single iterable as its only constructor argument.
        
        The `iterlist.IterList` behaves as a normal list, and will only
        evaluate the iterable as needed to satisfy requests for element.
        
        If there is a request for index `[5]`, then elements 0 - 5 will be
        evaluated if they have not been yet. Certain operations like `len` and
        negative indexing will force the list to be evaluated. This decision was made
        to make the iterlist outwardly appear as much like a normal list as possible.
        
        ## Infinite Iterators
        
        This implementation does not make any attempt to protect you from running out
        of memory attempting to construct a list from an infinite iterator. A future
        version may implement `InfiniteIterList`, which will not have support for any
        operation which would require consuming the entire iterable.
