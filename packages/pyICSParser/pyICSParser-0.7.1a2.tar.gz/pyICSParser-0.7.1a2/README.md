pyICSParser - ICALENDAR Parser
==============================

pyICSParser is an icalendar parser (parser for .ics or ical parser files) as defined 
by RFC5545 (previously RFC2445) into typed structure and returns 
json structure with explicit dates [[dates, description, uid]] for each instance

Typical usage for explicit date calculation:

  #!/usr/bin/env python
	
	from pyICSParser import ical
	
	mycal = ical.ics(start,end)
	#start and end are string objects of yyyymmdd type
	mycal.local_load(file)
	#file being a string for the local path to the icalendar file
	mycal.parse_loaded()
	mycal.flatten()
	dates = sorted(mycal.flat_events)
	#dates will contain the json with all explicit dates of the events spec'ed by the icalendar file

Versions
